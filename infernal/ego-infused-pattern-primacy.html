        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is not the place of the universe to dictate the identity of the Principle of Hierarchy. Whenever a Shaping effect alters an Infernal with this Charm in a manner her player does not approve of, the character&rsquo;s Essence reasserts its integrity like an immune system waging war on a plague. The offending Shaping reverses itself after one hour, during which time the character suffers a -1 internal penalty to all nonreflexive actions from the psychic effort of resistance and can&rsquo;t be further changed by continued exposure or reapplication of the same Shaping effect during this time. Thus, healing from Wyld-induced mutation ensures immunity to further mutation while recovering, but Shaping inflicted by a Charm would only leave the Infernal immune to that singular Charm. Until the Shaping reverses itself, the Exalt must still contend with all effects of his changed state. If the character suffers multiple undesired Shaping effects, they heal back in whatever order the Infernal&rsquo;s player chooses, but only one effect heals at a time. It is possible to initiate healing against Shaping the character originally permitted, should the change become undesirable.</p>
<p>A second purchase at Essence 3+ shortens the interval of regeneration to one minute. A third purchase (still at Essence 3+) allows instantaneous recovery for a reflexive cost of two motes, as the Infernal begins changing back before the offending Shaping fully resolves.</p>

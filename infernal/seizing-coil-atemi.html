        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Shadow of All Things spreads his darkness so that he might know all things and that all things might know him. The character may use this Charm to supplement any attack made against characters standing within the pall of Noon as Night Evocation. If the attack accrues any post-soak damage, a massive torrent of black Essence wells up around the victim, dragging them into the air no more than ten yards off the ground. Gigantic characters (such as the Ebon Dragon) may raise their captives higher, to just below eye level. If the victim is an Exalt, this utter darkness strangles their anima as it binds them in powerful coils of shadow. This is an automatically successful clinch which will maintain itself using the Infernal&rsquo;s (Wits + Essence), with a number of automatic successes on every renewal of the clinch equal to the post-soak damage of the initial attack. The coils have a base damage of the Infernal&rsquo;s (Essence + Willpower)B, and will attempt to crush an opponent into submission so long as the Infernal maintains this effect. Characters lacking countermagic spells may physically attack shadow coils in order to free their allies. Shadow coils have the same DVs and soak as their creator, and must suffer three or more levels of damage from a single attack to disrupt them.</p>
<p>The Infernal may not attack a victim caught in his Seizing Coil Atemi without the use of free reflexive attacks. However, he may continue to attack other opponents within the shadows, and may capture (Essence) foes simultaneously using this Charm. Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, the Infernal must keep motes committed to Seizing Coil Atemi for the duration of the effect—typically until the clinch is broken, a relevant countermagic spell is cast, or he chooses to release a victim from his coils. If the pall created by Noon as Night Evocation is dispelled, all coils immediately release their victims as the effect terminates.</p>

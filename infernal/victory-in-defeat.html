        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Although the Ebon Dragon loathes his confinement above all else, he also understands the necessity of biding his time. An Infernal may use this Charm whenever a hostile mental influence overcomes his defenses and he may pay Willpower to resist/mitigate the effects (i.e. he has the required points available). By activating this Charm, the character refuses to pay the Willpower cost and accepts the influence&rsquo;s hold over him. However, he regains one Willpower from his voluntarily submission while his attacker loses one Willpower (and gains one Limit if she has a Limit track). The Infernal may even acquiesce to social attacks that violate his Motivation or Urge.</p>
<p>Victory in Defeat does not provide a constant stream of Willpower for acquiescing to harmless or mildly inconveniencing requests, such as a merchant hawking his wares. Hostility means actual harm to the Infernal or something he values, especially influence that makes him act against his own interests.</p>

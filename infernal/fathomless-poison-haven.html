        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sea That Marched Against the Flame drowns all things but herself. The Infernal can target herself, any beloved object, beloved character, or, with Essence 3+, beloved structure. Separate activations can protect multiple targets concurrently. While the Charm is active, the target becomes immune to physical harm resulting from immersion or exposure to all liquids. All liquid is as the purest air to breathe and purest water to drink. This shields living beneficiaries from drowning and allows them to swim in lava, acid or high-pressure ocean trenches without harm. The protection also extends to owned possessions worn or carried on a protected being, provided they aren&rsquo;t notably larger than the Infernal.</p>
<p>The Great Mother&rsquo;s self-immunity also renders beneficiaries immune to harm from non-magical Poison effects. However, the first time each scene in which a target would have suffered harm from poison without this Charm, the warlock internalizes the toxin within her soul. This counts as a scene spent developing a negative Intimacy toward an individual or group of people who have given some offense to the warlock in the past week (however trivial). Intoxication isn&rsquo;t harm except to the degree it causes penalties, so the Infernal experiences full euphoria from intoxicants without drawback.</p>
<p>Repurchase at Essence 3+ improves the poison resistance to encompass magical toxins. If the Infernal targets herself, the protection simultaneously shields all beloved characters within (Essence x 100) yards.</p>

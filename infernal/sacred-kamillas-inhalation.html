        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The ragged gasps of the Silent Wind inhale promises, endings and sometimes worlds. This Charm may be activated only while the Infernal moves away from a target corpse or corpses that he is aware of within (Essence x 10) yards. The corpse dissolves into the wind like stone eroded by the gales of uncounted eons. Possessions do not deteriorate. Even as its mass ceases to be, the universe maintains harmonious equilibrium by the spontaneous generation and inhalation of Essence-infused breath within the body of the Infernal.</p>
<p>Drawing this breath assures the character can breathe safely in all climates and conditions for a number of hours equal to the corpses inhaled. If the Infernal inhales a corpse he personally killed, he gains mystical ownership of all objects on the victim&rsquo;s person left behind when the cadaver ceased to exist. Items that the deceased did not own at the time of death remain the possessions of their rightful owner. This Charm cannot dissolve corpses that have been imbued with animation of any sort.</p>
<p>This Charm grows in power with the Infernals who master it. At Essence 3+, the air provided by each corpse inhalation increases from one hour to one day. Essence 5+ confers the power to inhale (and thus annihilate) animate corpse extras. This automatically ejects any possessing beings. With Essence 7+, non-extra walking dead may be inhaled, though necromantic war machines notably larger than a single human remain off limits.</p>

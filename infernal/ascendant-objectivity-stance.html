        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>From above, She Who Lives In Her Name looks down on the messy chaos of a world desperate for her order. The Infernal&rsquo;s anima crystallizes and cracks, releasing a shard of light that grows into a narrow single-person platform that floats in mid-air, waiting for its creator to step on and claim it. The platform has soak and other traits as per a construct fashioned with Crystal-Fire Barrier Technique. If the Infernal steps on it with Mind-Hand Manipulation active, his feet adhere, and he gains the ability to hover and fly at up to ([Essence rating] x [natural ground speed]). The platform provides 50% cover from below. Should the Exalt suffer any knockback or knockdown while flying (or if the platform is destroyed by damage), this Charm deactivates and must be reactivated prior to hitting the ground to avoid impact. Hitting the platform deliberately requires a called shot at no penalty. If the directed attack hits the Infernal, it hits the platform and applies damage to it instead.</p>

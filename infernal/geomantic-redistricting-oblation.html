        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is not sufficient to blight the land to subsume Creation into the Demon City. The very Essence of the world must yield in submission to the glory of Malfeas before he can feel free. Whenever an Infernal uses Radiant Fury Dissolution to shatter a demon, god or an Infernal Exalt within the bounds of a demesne or the central chamber of a Manse, Geomantic Redistricting Oblation alchemically transmutes the explosion of pain shards into something far worse. For this process to corrupt a demesne, the being must have an Essence rating higher than the site&rsquo;s rating. Manses are more stable and thus harder to corrupt, requiring a victim with a minimum Essence of (rating + 2). It is also possible to create a new level 1 Vitriol-aspect demesne within an area blighted by Sun-Salted Fields by shattering an Essence 6+ god, demon or Infernal on that location.</p>
<p>If the above conditions are met, the horrid alchemy begins, shattering any hearthstones (if a manse) and changing the site&rsquo;s aspect toward the Malfean element of Vitriol over a period of days equal to its rating (or one month, if creating a new demesne). During this period of transition, the change can be reversed with appropriate countermagic and any attempt to draw Essence from the site in any way yields no Essence. Instead, the high saturation of spiritual poison inflicts dice of bashing damage equal to the motes that would have been gained instead. All beings not native to Malfeas feel ill whenever they approach within one mile of the changing site, suffering a -1 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions as a Sickness effect. Once the transition completes, the process can&rsquo;t be undone with countermagic and the effects associated with the conversion abate. Manses grow a new hearthstone during the change, with powers that the Storyteller should create or approve based on the stone&rsquo;s rating and the nature of the spirit killed to start the change.</p>
<p>Killing a city father this way in a manse located within that god&rsquo;s home city is even more spectacular, as the radiated discomfort penalizes everyone within the city for the next month (even if conversion finishes sooner). Appropriate countermagic only stops the aura if applied during the period of change; otherwise the grief must run its course. The death of any Incarna within the Jade Pleasure dome would affect Yu-Shan similarly, but the penalty would be -5 and would last for one year, driving all but the hardiest gods to evacuate.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Some demons escape the prison of their ancestor overlords. Sometimes this serves the will of the Yozis. Often, the broken creators simply resent inferiors enjoying privileges they may not. To end such frustrations, an Infernal may use this Charm to select any perceived demon within (Essence x 100) yards. The demon in question appears to slightly erode at the edges, with patches of skin crumbling first to dust and then seeming nothingness as the scoured away Essence trickles into Cecelyne. This process is too slow to result in any actual injury. However, for as long as the Charm remains active, the demon can&rsquo;t heal by any means. Whenever it suffers levels of damage, the injured tissue dissolves further (this cosmetic injury doesn&rsquo;t increase the number of levels suffered). After applying each damage level, the Storyteller checks whether the total number of non-bashing damage levels currently applied to the demon exceeds its Essence rating. Once this threshold is reached, the spirit disintegrates completely and its scattered Essence makes the five-day crossing to reform in the dunes just outside the walls of Malfeas. The spirit arrives in the same condition as it vanished. Scouring Banishment technique may be activated multiple times to mark different demons for banishment. The cost is five motes (plus one Willpower if the target belongs to the Second or Third Circle). With Essence 4+, the Infernal may use a single activation to affect as many valid targets as desired, provided she pays the requisite cost for each. Essence 6+ drops the cost to target First Circle demons to one mote each.</p>
<p>Essence 3+ Infernals may purchase this Charm a second time. In addition to the usual effects, targeted demons can&rsquo;t regain Willpower from stunts. Other means of Willpower recovery function normally. Furthermore, if a targeted demon runs out of Willpower points for any reason, it dissolves and reforms in the sands outside Malfeas as explained above.</p>
<p>A third purchase requires Essence 4+, extending the Charms power to affect gods, elementals and devas as though they were demons (eroding via damage and Willpower loss alike). The Yozis can feel whenever a god enters their realm this way and know the identity of that deity. How and whether they respond depends on how much they personally hate the intruder. The titans consider elementals below Essence 6 too pathetic to notice this way, though greater elementals draw their attention like gods.</p>
<p>Ceclyne does not like to think of the Underworld, and so it has not occurred to her that a fourth purchase is possible (also requiring Essence 4+). This purchase broadens its power to affect ghosts as per other spirits, though the Yozis never dignify the dead with automatic notice. It remains to be seen how long it will take for a warlock to realize this possibility and so force Cecelyne to gain this power. Perhaps she will be grateful to know she can damn the dead to the eternal suffering of the Demon Realm. Perhaps she will be horrified by the reminder of her own mortality. Only time will tell.</p>

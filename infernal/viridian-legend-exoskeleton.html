        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A fine patina of blue-green tarnish rapidly spreads like mold over the character&rsquo;s body, flaking away to reveal a more durable layer of shining brass etched with maddening spiral patterns and Old Realm characters that tell the stories of Malfeas and foretell the punishments he would inflict upon his enemies. Players of observers literate in Old Realm receive a three-die bonus on all Occult rolls to know such facts while they can see the Infernal. These characters glow pale green, impairing their bearer&rsquo;s stealth as per a four- to seven-mote anima banner display.</p>
<p>Viridian Legend Exoskeleton is not studied for its luminous history lessons, however. The exoskeleton of living brass provides powerful armor with the following statistics: Soak +10L/+10B, with no mobility or fatigue penalty. This organic alloy has Hardness equal to its soak against attacks made without help of a Charm or artifact weapon. The Viridian Legend Exoskeleton has Hardness 5B/5L against magical attacks. By default, this Charm is incompatible with other armor.</p>
<p>Infernals with Essence 4+ may purchase this Charm a second time, allowing the exoskeleton to grow around and reinforce existing armor. This hybrid armor can&rsquo;t be removed while the Charm is active and has the combined soak of the two armors, the best Hardness values between the armors, no fatigue or movement penalties and all other powers either armor possessed (such as Hardness equaling soak against nonmagical attacks). This purchase also increases the Charm&rsquo;s duration to Indefinite. The Essence 4+ repurchase costs an additional 7m to invoke.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal stokes the furnace of his stomach, igniting a corrosive Essence flame within his guts. He may consume any matter he can fit in his mouth and it nourishes him as if it were the finest repast. He can perfectly digest the most toxic or diseaseriddled substances without any ill effects, though indestructible objects like most artifacts simply pass through his digestion unharmed (and without harming him). Use of this Charm tends to skew the Infernal&rsquo;s palate, giving him all manner of alien cravings. Matter consumed while using this Charm is digested immediately and doesn&rsquo;t become dangerous again within the body. This Charm is equally effective at addressing hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>In lieu of enchanting themselves, Infernals may use By Hunger Nourished to enchant another being with a touch. If the target is not a native of Malfeas, she does not automatically acclimate to the taste of anything normally inedible to her, requiring a Stamina + Resistance roll to avoid vomiting immediately (difficulty 1-5 based on how vile the substance is). It is possible to provide such acclimation as part of activating the Charm, however, in which case the substance becomes the best-tasting food the target can remember eating. The Infernal may alternately impose a more limited &ldquo;gift&rdquo; that allows the target to eat one specific substance, but the target must roll to resist vomiting at difficulty 6 whenever she eats anything else for the duration of the Charm.</p>
<p>Repeated use of this Charm to make a victim unable to eat anything at hand will eventually lead to fatal starvation. It is possible to select matter that is utterly inaccessible, like the tears of Saturn, though most Infernals stick with the old comic standby of making prisoners eat their own excrement. Though they might wish otherwise, targets with modified diets intuitively understand what they need to eat to survive.</p>

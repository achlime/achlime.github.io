            <p>Malfeas is invincible, immortal, and incomparable. Those who would dare offer evidence to the contrary will be ground to a paste between his layers as a lesson to others. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it gains motes under the following circumstances: The first time in a scene that the Infernal marks off his incapacitated health box with a certain type of damage (bashing, lethal, or aggravated), he gains ten offensive motes. This gain is cumulative—if the Infernal filled his Incapacitated health box with bashing damage, and then later in the same scene with lethal damage, he would gain a total of 20 motes. However, if he healed himself and then marked off the box with lethal damage again during that scene, he would gain no motes.</p>

            <p>Adorjan&rsquo;s daughter, the Brilliant Wind, sometimes imagines she can outpace her mother. In the end, she merely outpaces her mother&rsquo;s madness. This Charm may only be activated on the Infernal&rsquo;s action tick and no more than once per tick. As Racing Vitaris activates, the Exalt launches forward at superhuman acceleration, trailing strobe-flicker afterimages tinted in the colors of the Exalt&rsquo;s anima. This display obviates Stealth like an eight to ten mote anima banner. Everyone without supernatural balance standing within five yards of the Infernal&rsquo;s initial position must check for knockdown at a difficulty of the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence rating. This Charm triples the Exalt&rsquo;s base movement rate for its duration. However, the character must maintain maximum dashing speed or the Charm terminates. Racing Vitaris may be reactivated to release another shockwave.</p>
<p>At Essence 4+, activation of this Charm releases a flash of light in addition to a burst of force. Mortals within 100 yards with a clear line of sight to the acceleration are automatically blinded until the Infernal&rsquo;s next action tick, though characters who prepare by closing their eyes in advance are immune. With Essence 5, the light gains the power to temporarily blind magical beings as thought they were mortals, though any whose players succeed at a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll at difficulty 3 can look away in time to avoid blinding. Essence 6+ worsens matters for mortals and animals, permanently blinding them as a Crippling effect. Heroic mortals can make a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll at difficulty 5 to look away and suffer momentary blindness rather than permanent loss of sight. This flash of light is not optional, nor does it differentiate friend from foe.</p>

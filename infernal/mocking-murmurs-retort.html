        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal parrots the words of a foe, perhaps speaking a half second behind like an echo or modulating his voice with exaggerated distortions or even repeating key phrases as part of a grander insulting oration. While his manner of rebuke may seem childish, it is actually a form of anti-speech, a vocalized principle of incoherence and insanity that drains the opponent&rsquo;s words of all persuasive power. Mocking Murmurs Retort can defend against any form of mental or social influence as a perfect parry so long as that influence is not unexpected, even stopping unblockable attacks and those operating outside the timeframe of social combat. The cost to use Mocking Murmurs Retort later in the scene against further mental influence from the same attacker decreases by one mote, to a minimum of one mote once the Infernal has used this Charm five or more times against that opponent. The Infernal does have to audibly vocalize anti-speech (even against a written attack), but may incoherently mumble under his breath if he doesn&rsquo;t want to make it obvious what he is doing. This Charm is vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Shadow of All Things.</p>
<p>Whenever an Essence 5+ Infernal uses Mocking Murmurs Retort to defend against a non-targeted social attack (like most Performance-based attacks), he may pay an extra four motes and add the Obvious keyword to his response. If he does, the Charm perfectly parries the attack for all listeners who observe his response, but he cannot hide his response in whispers.</p>

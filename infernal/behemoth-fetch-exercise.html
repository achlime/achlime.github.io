        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The pets of the Yozis are not so dissimilar to the pets of mortals, save perhaps for the scope of exertions required to keep them happy and healthy. This Charm may enhance any close combat attack that successfully hits a target no greater than triple the warlock&rsquo;s own size. The target must be a single being or object; structures may not be toppled this way. The enhanced attack swats the target away in a direction of the Infernal&rsquo;s choice a distance equaling the number of yards the warlock moved via her own locomotion on the previous tick. If terrain allows, the victim skids to a halt stunned and prone, but suffering no further harm. If deliberately hurled into a solid barrier, the victim suffers dice of damage equal to the distance she would have continued to travel (maximum 25) and then slumps to the ground, stunned and prone. This damage is normally bashing, but may be lethal depending on the composition of the barrier.</p>
<p>If the Infernal uses this Charm where a Primordial behemoth or natural animal can see her do so, all of her subsequent actions to control, communicate with or train that creature later in the scene are at target number 6 rather than 7. Interactions with other similar beings may enjoy this benefit with Storyteller approval. Unrolled actions are unaffected. This perk doesn&rsquo;t improve if a creature observes multiple activations of this Charm.</p>
<p>If the Infernal has Essence 3+ and any Primordial behemoths or predatory natural animals observe the Infernal use this Charm to knock away something that they consider edible, the beasts feel an unnatural Compulsion to attack and devour the food source until successful or the scene ends. Resisting this urge costs only one Willpower and may be done at any time, but beasts will normally only resist if they personally know and care about the target as something more than a snack.</p>

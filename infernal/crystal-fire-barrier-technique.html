        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By hardening natural law into a tangible force, the Principle of Hierarchy defines her environment to aid allies and hinder enemies. This Charm may only be activated on the Infernal&rsquo;s action tick until he has Essence 5+, at which point he may use it in Step 2 of attack resolution to defensively create constructs in the path of attacks. The Charm can&rsquo;t be used more than once per tick for any reason. Upon activation, the Infernal chooses an origin point no greater than (Essence x 10) yards away. Translucent white light expands from that point, crystallizing into a single-layer construct of solid force whose dimensions can be arrayed as a wall, sphere, ovoid or anything in between of comparable simplicity. No dimension of the construct can exceed (Essence x 20) yards across. If characters do not wish to be trapped on a particular side of the barrier and they have a sufficient move rate to cross to the desired side, they may do so before the light hardens. In addition to being vulnerable to countermagic, constructs made with this Charm are inanimate objects with (Essence x 4) bashing and lethal soak and are destroyed upon suffering any damage. The Infernal can also dismiss them at will. The barriers are equally solid to material and incorporeal objects and provide usual cover, but their creator can move through them as if they were incorporeal whenever he wishes to do so. Attacking through the barrier isn&rsquo;t possible. Once created, constructs are stationary and can&rsquo;t be moved, only destroyed.</p>

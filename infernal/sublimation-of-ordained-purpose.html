        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Endless Desert wears away the impurities of corruption, scraping away until perfection is attained. This Charm can enhance any social attack aimed specifically at a single god or demon in which the Infernal compels that target to fulfill the official purpose for which it came into existence. In the case of gods, this means managing their dominion without regard to personal profit or other distractions. Demons must act out the mad urges that spawned them over personal ambitions or preferences. An attack enhanced by this Charm becomes an undodgeable unnatural mental influence. If successful, the target must spend a number of Willpower points equal to the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence rating (maximum five) to resist. This cost may be paid gradually, but until the final point is paid, an affected spirit remains unable to take actions outside the scope of its purpose. This Charm can affect elementals as though they were gods, provided that the elementals hold office in the Celestial Bureaucracy (such as censors).</p>
<p>Demons affected by this Charm can be sorcerously bound and ordered to take actions that oppose the dictates of Sublimation of Ordained Purpose. However, each time the demon is forced into such a contradiction to take a non-reflexive action, it loses a Willpower point. If this reduces it to Willpower 0, both compulsions break, and it fully replenishes its Willpower pool. The demon may then act freely. Heaven notices the freeing of a Third Circle Demon as a Blasphemy effect.</p>

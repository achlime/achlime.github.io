        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm expands the scope of its prerequisite, allowing that Charm to bestow permanent mutations as an alternative to other traits. The mutations in question must fulfill a desire, though they can do so in ways the supplicant never imagined or wanted. For example, it is necessary to become a creature of darkness for the Desecration to do anything else, so any desire to be changed automatically makes that mutation permissible. Moreover, the changes must suit the aesthetics of the Endless Desert, incorporating only those physical characteristics suited for dwelling within her and mental changes congruent with her law.</p>
<p>Any single permissible mutation may be given by each application of this Charm, within the normal limits of Verdant Emptiness Endowment and the Desecration keyword. All of the effects of <a class="complex" href="transcendent-desert-creature.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Transcendent Desert Creature'"><span class="link-focus">Transcendent Desert Creature</span></a> may be given as an Abomination with the same name.</p>
<p>Alternately, this Charm may also be used to remove mutations, in which case the target still owes the Infernal later, but the former mutant regains any experience points invested in the trait. It is not uncommon for Cecelyne to give a mutation and collect the price, then collect again to remove the gift when the target comes to fear and hate what he has become.</p>

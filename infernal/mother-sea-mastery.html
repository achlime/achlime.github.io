        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Kimbery moves upon and through herself freely, for her nature is its own dominion. Upon learning this Charm, the character gains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>She adds (Essence) bonus successes to all Attribute and/or Ability rolls to harvest food from liquid or move effectively and safely via a liquid medium. Attacks never benefit, not even to remove obstacles. Examples of valid actions include: fishing, gathering kelp, swimming, resisting fatigue from swimming, holding one&rsquo;s breath while submerged, balancing on a ship&rsquo;s deck in turbulent seas, piloting aquatic vehicles and riding aquatic mounts.</li>
<li>As an aquatic being, she ignores the -2 penalty terrestrial beings suffer to move while submerged. Her actions move through liquid like air, allowing her to do seemingly impossible feats like swing sledges and fire bows underwater.</li>
<li>She may multiply her swimming speed by her Essence rating. Obvious currents of ichor drag her forward and trail behind (Essence x 100) yards while using this power, adding one success to track her for a half hour. She can accelerate other means of personally moving via liquid (such as walking on it).</li>
<li>With Essence 3+, neither she nor any aquatic mount she rides suffers fatigue from actions this Charm assists.</li>
</ul>

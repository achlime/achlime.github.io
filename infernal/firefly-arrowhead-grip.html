        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When one is fast enough to sidestep arrows, catching them is as easy as plucking insects from the air. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm uses Who Strikes The Wind? to defend against a ranged attack, she may either dodge it as normal or apply a perfect parry by swatting the projectile aside with her hand or a close combat weapon. If the character uses an empty hand to block a solid projectile, she catches it and arms herself with it to the best degree possible. This Charm is not compatible with effects that extend the effectiveness of <a class="complex" href="who-strikes-the-wind.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Who Strikes the Wind?'"><span class="link-focus">Who Strikes The Wind?</span></a> past one instant, such as <a class="complex" href="laughing-gust-denial.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Laughing Gust Denial'"><span class="link-focus">Laughing Gust Denial</span></a>. The Imperfection of the Silent Wind applies only to the Infernal&rsquo;s movement, not that of any beneficiaries she might protect with a Defend Other action (see <strong>Glories of the Most High—Luna</strong>, p. 22).</p>
<p>At Essence 4+, parried projectiles may be caught and &ldquo;carried&rdquo; in eddies of wind spinning around the Exalt. Such items may be knocked from their irregular orbit with a successful disarm attack and may be grabbed and wielded by the warlock as if they were stored on her person. More importantly, the warlock can reflexively hurl all captured projectiles into an enemy to enhance a close combat attack, with each item adding one die to the attack roll (up to the normal limits for Charm bonuses) and two to the attack&rsquo;s raw damage. Projectiles exceeding this limit still fly at the target, but to no additional effect. Hurled missiles then drop to the ground, no longer held by Firefly Arrowhead Grip.</p>

            <p><em>This charm is a specialisation of <a class="complex" href="first-yozi-excellency.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'First (Yozi) Excellency'"><span class="link-focus">First (Yozi) Excellency</span></a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kimbery:</strong> The Great Mother is <em>endlessly giving</em> and <em>too often forgiving</em>, a <em>self-defined victim</em> of endless betrayal. She holds others to <em>impossibly high standards</em>, but <em>thinks she is fair</em>. Secrets are among the greatest purviews of her depths, particularly shameful truths and those kept with force and guile. Though her <em>patronage and kindness are real</em>, spurning her incites fury that <em>drowns all opposition</em> in her <em>corrosive</em> touch. Kimbery hides <em>ugliness beyond imagining</em> beneath playful waves of <em>beauty</em>, <em>charm</em> and <em>poise</em>.</p>
<p>The Great Mother rejects the immediacy of brute force violence in favor of poison, <em>acid</em>, <em>bleeding</em>, <em>curses</em>, <em>disease</em> and other tactics that perpetuate <em>spiteful suffering</em> without further effort. Her social tricks follow the same logic, stirring <em>undercurrents of distrust</em> and <em>dissent</em> beneath the polite surface of society until the entire organization <em>dissolves</em>. Some Yozis call Kimbery lazy and cowardly for striking once and holding back while afflicted victims weaken, but she considers this <em>elegant practicality</em>.</p>
<p>Everything she does <em>harms</em> someone or <em>sets them up to suffer worse</em> in the future, but she is capable of <em>martyring</em> herself to be the one in pain. Because her depths hold <em>no lasting generosity</em>, she <em>demands payment</em> proportional to her sacrifice. Whether beneficiaries ask for her gifts or not doesn&rsquo;t matter, but she <em>gleefully tortures</em> those who insult her by refusing her largesse. Those who cannot pay her back conventionally <em>pay with screams</em>.</p>
<p>She takes great pride in <em>brokering deals</em>, offering the just and true their <em>darkest desires</em> so that she may see them brought low. She considers herself to be the <em>ultimate trafficker</em>, moving everything from worlds to secrets, with a <em>discerning eye</em> for an advantageous bargain. She has a <em>talent for temptation</em>, using <em>secret lusts</em> against her enemies as a <em>rook</em> into <em>further disfigurement</em>.</p>
<p>That Kimbery takes pleasure in the <em>agonies of subordinates</em> is her worst-kept secret, but she <em>sacrifices this joy</em> to <em>avoid wasting what is hers</em>. She shows <em>no restraint in tormenting enemies</em>, punishing them for actual transgressions and venting her <em>bottled-up fury</em> toward all who escape punishment. The Sea That Marched Against the Flame loves to warp herself and others into new shapes as <em>useful as they are uncomfortable</em>, imagining herself a <em>great artist</em>. She may be right, but even her siblings find her aesthetics <em>bizarre</em> and <em>vile</em>.</p>
<p>Kimbery&rsquo;s Excellency aids actions that create <em>disturbing art</em> in any media, whether conventional paintings and sculptures or artful blood spatters on a wall. Appropriate stunts can make almost anything into vile art. Her power helps <em>keep secrets by any means necessary</em>. This Charm assists all actions to cause <em>delayed or ongoing harm</em>. Purely immediate harm falls outside Kimbery&rsquo;s purview unless punishing someone who has benefited from her help or betrayed her love. She may also impose harm for the <em>sadistic joy</em> of doing so rather than expediency or necessity.</p>

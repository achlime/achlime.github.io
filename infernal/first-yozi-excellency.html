        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Like their lesser creations, the Yozis can channel Essence to make themselves more competent at tasks. Befitting their nature, however, the Yozis do not think in terms of innate talent or learned skill (i.e., Attributes or Abilities), but rather according to the concepts they embody. Thus, Malfeas is mightiest when he takes a direct approach, while the Ebon Dragon must act indirectly and subtly to exert his full glory. So long as the action in question meets the criteria established for the Yozi in question, this Charm can enhance actions using any combination of Attribute and/or Ability. Only one iteration of First (Yozi) Excellency may improve a given action.</p>
<p>The Storyteller should adjudicate the applicability of this Charm as he would judge applicability of specialties and stunts, rewarding players who work to stay in theme and denying those who would push these Excellencies into universally applicable bonuses. As always, clear and consistent rulings will go a long way to keeping players happy. Infernals must learn each Yozi&rsquo;s Excellency separately. <strong>Furthermore, a character can and must purchase each version of the Charm a number of times equal to her Essence rating as a Training effect when she first learns the Excellency or upon raising her Essence later.</strong> Consequently, each Excellency taken at character creation needs two Charm slots (assuming Essence 2), so players should plan Charm selections accordingly.</p>
<p>First (Yozi) Excellency adds dice to enhance valid actions using the same costs and rules as the <a class="complex" href="../solar/first-ability-excellency.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'First (Ability) Excellency'"><span class="link-focus">First (Ability) Excellency</span></a> of the Lawgivers (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 183). If the action uses only an Attribute or Ability and not a combination of the two, the dice limit is the (used trait + Essence) instead. The italicized words and phrases in the descriptions below provide the core themes of each Yozi purview. The more of these relate to a given action, the more likely that a Storyteller should consider the action eligible for enhancement with the Excellency.</p>
<p><strong>Malfeas:</strong> The fallen King of the Primordials is <em>arrogant</em>, <em>cruel</em> and given to <em>excessive</em> displays of <em>obvious</em> force for the chance to show off and the <em>sadistic</em> joy he feels when enemies and allies look upon him in <em>awe</em> and <em>terror</em>. He is <em>vast</em> and full of <em>hate</em> toward those who betrayed and imprisoned him, seeking <em>vengeance</em> with <em>indiscriminate callousness</em> to the <em>collateral damage</em> he inflicts on the innocent. The Demon City is <em>resilient</em> and <em>strong</em> enough to lift the world or <em>crush</em> it underfoot. The green fires raging in his heart <em>blight</em> the very Essence of everything they touch, marking the world with his <em>wrathful glory</em>. He holds <em>authority</em> over all things wise enough to bow before the world&rsquo;s creators.</p>
<p>Characters may apply this Charm to any actions in which they choose the <em>ostentatious</em> or <em>overkill</em> approach over merely adequate solutions. Any intentional subtlety or display of restraint makes this Excellency inapplicable, including adding less than half the maximum possible dice bonus to a roll (rounded down). Note that force does not necessarily equate to violence. A forceful seduction in which an Infernal confidently orders a prospective paramour to accompany him rather than cajoling or flattering her can benefit from this Charm just as readily as a stomp delivered to a prone enemy&rsquo;s face. Strangely, the power of Malfeas may also enhance any Performance action to dance or create music. These are the secret pleasures of the Demon City that embarrass Ligier.</p>
<p><strong>Cecelyne:</strong> The Endless Desert is <em>patient</em> and <em>deliberate</em>. She <em>holds back</em>, <em>amassing</em> resources until she can <em>overwhelm</em> her opposition. Her law places the <em>strong over the weak</em>, celebrating a doctrine of <em>arbitrary</em> and <em>capricious hypocrisy</em>. She demands reverence from allies and enemies alike and works <em>terrifying and wondrous miracles</em> to expand her worship. She is deeply <em>insightful</em> into the <em>desires</em> and <em>failures</em> of others and owns those whose <em>wishes she fulfills</em>. She borders <em>everything and eternity</em>, so everyone <em>comes to her</em> in time. Her heart <em>overflows</em> with <em>desolation</em>, turning all around her to literal or metaphorical <em>wasteland</em>. When her patience runs out or her plans reach fruition, her rage is <em>sudden</em> and <em>shocking</em>.</p>
<p>Characters may apply this Charm to any actions in which they build on <em>prior planning and effort</em> to succeed more <em>thoroughly</em> or <em>carefully</em>. Cecelyne&rsquo;s Excellency also assists actions that <em>give others what they want</em> in order to <em>influence and ultimately own</em> them. She also helps <em>punish</em> those who break a deal or betray their loyalty to the Infernal or his laws. The Charm may assist any attempt to <em>amass</em> or <em>jealously protect</em> resources that are <em>directly useful</em> to the Exalt&rsquo;s <em>established plans</em>, but has no power to help spur-of-the-moment whims, acts of meaningless self-indulgence or displays of truly selfless altruism. The Endless Desert helps Infernals <em>endure unrelentingly harsh conditions</em>, whether physical or social, as well as resist challenges to their long-term plans. The Charm does not help characters resist random misfortune, nor can it thwart actions of those advancing an agenda unrelated to the Infernal&rsquo;s long-term goals.</p>
<p><strong>She Who Lives In Her Name:</strong> The Principle of Hierarchy is <em>methodical</em> and <em>meticulous</em>. She <em>analyzes every variable</em> and chooses the most <em>efficient</em> and <em>orderly</em> method by which to achieve victory. Her <em>utilitarianism</em> is <em>absolute</em> and <em>consistent</em> as <em>clockwork</em>. She is as <em>brilliant</em> as she is <em>alien</em>, <em>cold</em> and <em>unfeeling</em>. Her violence is <em>dispassionate</em> and <em>perversely pure</em>, unmotivated by sadism and yet capable of <em>systematically disassembling</em> every obstacle in her path <em>without the slightest remorse</em>. She <em>builds</em> and <em>improves structures</em> of all kinds and abhors chaos, randomness and free will in all its forms. She finds excessive effort wasteful and prefers to apply the <em>minimum exertion necessary</em> to attain the desired outcome. Her <em>directives</em> are <em>fascist</em> and <em>totalitarian</em>, but <em>ruthlessly fair</em>. She has no moral restraint against deception, nor any attachment to honesty, but her nature must choose the most <em>expedient</em> method even when it is not the solution that best matches her talents. She demands <em>perfection</em>, especially from herself.</p>
<p>Characters may apply this Charm to actions that <em>create new order</em> or <em>reinforce existing order</em> in any way, as well as actions that encourage others to <em>join and loyally follow</em> any <em>hierarchical organization</em>. She Who Lives In Her Name enhances efficient actions that demonstrate <em>appropriate use of force</em>; her power does not aid half-hearted or excessive efforts. Showing empathy for individuals invalidates that action for enhancement, though empathy toward society or another collective structure is permissible. The Charm enhances actions carried out <em>methodically</em> and <em>logically</em> but not improvised or unconventional solutions. Spreading chaos is never allowed, but ineffective organizations and policies may be <em>dismantled</em> to pave the way for a better order.</p>
<p><strong>Adorjan:</strong> The Silent Wind is <em>restless</em>, <em>always in motion</em> and <em>never satisfied</em>. She expresses the <em>inevitability</em> that <em>bad things happen</em> regardless of who you are or how many backup plans you have. She is <em>catastrophe</em> and <em>calamity</em>, the <em>unconsidered variable</em> that <em>shreds the best-laid plans</em> of Yozi and Exalt alike. She <em>kills because it is her nature</em> to <em>hurt everything</em> she touches, not because she revels in suffering. More than any of her siblings, Adorjan is <em>insane</em> and <em>encompasses contradictions</em>. Adorjan <em>scours</em> her enemies, <em>breaking</em> them to <em>enlighten</em> them, even if the lesson proves fatal. Her actions display <em>vicious whimsy</em>, especially toward the complacent and comfortable. She loves <em>purposeful chaos</em> that <em>exposes the flaws</em> in systems and <em>lays low the proud</em>, but she <em>abhors chaos for the sake of chaos</em> as much as she <em>abhors stasis</em>. She is <em>balancing force</em> of <em>wickedness</em> against the excesses of the righteous. Her <em>depredations inspire heroes</em> to reach their full potential through the <em>crucible of tragedy</em>, invariably <em>ruining their lives</em> in the process. <em>Greatness</em> is the worst curse her touch imparts. She inflicts more pain on those she loves than those she hates. <em>No one expects her</em>. She <em>refuses to be understood</em> and torments those who try.</p>
<p>This Charm can enhance any action that causes unexpected or <em>sudden</em> harm, such as <em>surprise</em> attacks or attacks that are part of flurries. Actions that create ongoing <em>discomfort</em> or <em>take away sources of comfort</em> also fall under the purview of the Silent Wind. Socially, her attacks tear away Intimacies rather than building them, teaching people to <em>let go of attachments</em> and worries rather than continue meaningless cycles of love or vengeance. The behaviors she compels are mad and invariably <em>disturbing</em>, but she does not care how the minds of others break. Adorjan&rsquo;s power may be applied to any actions that help tear down structured society or spread <em>anarchy</em>, regardless of the reasons or methods for doing so. The Charm can&rsquo;t assist actions that are planned in great detail in advance, though it is permissible to do something whose consequences will not manifest until a later time. Actions motivated by insanity may only benefit from Adorjan&rsquo;s touch when there is some greater and immediate purpose behind them (even if the meaning isn&rsquo;t communicated to other characters). The Silent Wind embodies the madness of the <em>freed mind</em>, not an idiot&rsquo;s babbling.</p>
<p><strong>Ebon Dragon:</strong> The Shadow of All Things is <em>Other</em>, not wholly of the world nor fully alien to its precepts like the Neverborn. He is <em>self-indulgent</em> and <em>without conscience</em> but can be trusted to act with <em>enlightened self-interest</em> at all times, making him the most <em>dependable</em> and trustworthy of the Yozis so long as those dealing with him don&rsquo;t forget his nature. He <em>corrupts</em> and <em>seduces</em> others away from virtue and honor because these concepts are poisonous to him rather than because he wants to enlighten or enslave. He genuinely believes the universe should be darkened until it approaches his <em>unholy perfection</em>, but his <em>warped magnanimity</em> hides a deeper and greater <em>hatred of all light</em>—literal or metaphoric. The Ebon Dragon is <em>hollow</em>, assembling his <em>semblance of identity</em> from <em>lies, copied mannerisms</em> and observed <em>vices</em>, constantly <em>recreating himself</em> in the image of whatever <em>offends</em> and <em>frightens</em> his adversaries the most. Moreover, he is <em>The Nemesis</em>, finding greater joy in <em>thwarting the dreams of others</em> than advancing his own agenda. Whereas the Silent Wind brings agonizing freedom to others, the Ebon Dragon <em>can&rsquo;t abide his own restraint</em>, whether by prison walls or social mores.</p>
<p>This Excellency enhances actions that attack morality, break established moral codes or cheat in lieu of playing fair. This includes most <em>criminal</em> acts, except in societies where crime functions with the knowledge and quiet approval of the reigning government. Direct and intentional <em>violations</em> of the laws of Yu-Shan or the dictates of Cecelyne always offer chances for <em>antagonism</em>. The Shadow of All Things gleefully <em>turns heroes into villains</em> or reveals to a self-styled heroine how her actions <em>were actually villainous</em> all along. While a character with this Excellency experiences confinement or restraint, the Charm can only enhance actions that help him <em>break free</em> from that immediate imprisonment until he has done so. The Charm also can&rsquo;t assist actions that knowingly help anyone else more than they help the Infernal, even when he still stands to <em>profit</em> a great deal. A third limitation is that the character can&rsquo;t use the Charm when being honest, unless revealing a <em>horrid truth</em> that will <em>hurt</em> or <em>debase</em> the listener. Finally, all actions must show subtlety, if not outright guile. Choosing a brazen course of action over a subtle one forfeits any opportunity to use this Charm. In these restrictions, the Ebon Dragon&rsquo;s Excellency offers the most and least freedom of any Yozi.</p>

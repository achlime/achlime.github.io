        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lesser beings may run for a time and falter. They do not internalize the motion until it uplifts and rejuvenates them. Infernals with this Charm experience no fatigue while dashing. Any existing fatigue penalties from prior exertions abate for the duration, returning without improvement when the character stops dashing. At Essence 3+, the act of continuously dashing counts as rest for the purposes of alleviating fatigue. At Essence 4+, prolonged dashing also counts as meditation for the purpose of Essence recovery.</p>
<p>Reaching Essence 5+ initiates a more extreme metamorphosis, as continuous dashing counts as sleep for all recuperative purposes, including the opportunity for a Willpower recovery roll every eight hours. The Infernal even dreams while dashing, though this reflexively occurs on a separate level of consciousness and does not impair conscious actions. The character loses all recuperative benefits from actual sleep.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm expands its scope to include any form of continuous and normally fatiguing exertion in addition to dashing. The exertion must involve significant non-stationary movement. Gentle lovemaking would not suffice, though a wild romp spilling from room to room would.</p>

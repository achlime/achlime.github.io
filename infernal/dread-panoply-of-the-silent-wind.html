        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The wind travels light. Her only possessions are extensions of herself. The Infernal makes a mock attack at the air using a close combat weapon she owns. That weapon fades into the wind and disperses through Elsewhere, thereafter existing only as a vague potential for violence. Up to (Essence) weapons may be banished this way with separate Charm activations. Whenever the Exalt has the necessary hand(s) available to hold a banished weapon or matched pair and wishes to make an attack using that selection, she may reflexively pay one mote to summon it to her hand. Summoned weapons shimmer into existence wreathed in a flicker of bloody lightning, fading back into Elsewhere just as quickly after striking. If wielded for a flurry, weapons last for the entire flurry or until dismissed in favor of another summoned weapon, rather than costing one mote for each attack.</p>
<p>Appropriate countermagic targeting the Infernal&rsquo;s hands recalls all banished weapons, though they simply fall around her rather than usefully landing in her grip. Although weapons banished this way are almost impossible to disarm, they are also useless for parrying anything besides counterattacks. Once an Infernal has Essence 5+, banished weapons cost nothing to summon for an attack, though she can still only summon and wield one such weapon per attack.</p>

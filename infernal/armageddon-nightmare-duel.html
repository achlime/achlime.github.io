        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal Monster haunts his enemies. They see his ragecontorted face when they sleep. They feel his hot breath upon the back of their neck. They know he is coming for them. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal&rsquo;s eyes glaze over as though from a distracting daydream. A small smile curls at the corner of his lips. He is completely unaware of his environment and unable to take physical actions in this fugue state, but remains upright if standing. The trance lasts for the Charm&rsquo;s full duration, but his player may choose for him to reflexively snap out of it and end the Charm in order to react to stimuli (like an incoming attack). It is also possible to activate Armageddon Nightmare Duel while the Infernal is unconscious, focusing his dreams on distant prey.</p>
<p>This Charm is not studied as an idle distraction to avoid boredom. At the time of activation, the Infernal chooses an enemy he has tagged with Blood Heralds Death. If that enemy is awake, he knows this and activating the Charm costs him nothing. The tagged character momentarily hallucinates and imagines he sees the Infernal somewhere nearby, but his senses catch up a split second later to reveal he&rsquo;s just jumping at shadows. The delusion is unsettling, but too fleeting to have any mechanical impact.</p>
<p>If the tagged enemy is sleeping when Armageddon Nightmare Duel activates, paying fifteen motes and one Willpower allows the Infernal to meet the victim in a shared nightmare created by the Charm. Sleep means real sleep, not an alternative activity that counts as sleep for the target due to magic. This nightmare&rsquo;s terrain can contain any landscapes and environments natural to Creation and is arbitrarily vast, effectively an infinite plain on which to impose features as they are discovered. The Infernal and the victim are the only two beings in this world. Sessile life-forms like plants and fungi are permissible, as these qualify as scenery rather than actors in the psychodrama.</p>
<p>The two enter the dream in sight of one another, but no closer than one hundred yards. Neither can be placed in a starting position that is actively injurious to him, though targets immune to particular environmental hazards may begin exposed to such conditions. Inability to see or use similarly-acute senses is a special hazard for this purpose. The Infernal becomes aware of such immunities in the instant he activates the Charm so that he can set the stage appropriately. Storytellers should ensure that this rule is followed in spirit as well as letter. Placing an enemy on a tiny pedestal over a vast sea of lava with no way to move or escape without suffering burning horrid death is not technically a violation of the rule. Neither is placing a strongbut- slow enemy who can&rsquo;t see in the dark in pitch-black frozen cave so slick its floor can&rsquo;t be walked on without supernatural balance or astounding agility. Both scenarios are completely against the spirit of the Charm. Dangerous environments are permissible, but using them as weapons should require work and there should always be some means of avoiding the danger.</p>
<p>When the dream begins, the Infernal has full motes, Willpower, Virtue channels and health. He can choose not to carry over any lingering negative effects currently afflicting him into his dream self. In effect, his nightmare form is himself at full power, but with no Charms that require activations active. The victim enters the dream as she is in real life, but with no Charms active. If she is wounded or supernaturally beguiled or mutated into a three-armed freak outside the dream, she remains so within the dream. Both characters immediately join battle. Time flows in the dream at the same rate as reality, so the dream cannot actually take or appear to take longer than (the Infernal&rsquo;s Martial Arts) minutes.</p>
<p>Nothing that happens to the Infernal in the dream has any bearing on his actual self. If he dies or falls unconscious within the dream, the Charm ends and the dream ends for both parties. This also severs the sorcerous tag connecting the Infernal to that victim like countermagic. The victim has much more at stake. Any motes spent in the dream are lost to no real effect, though Exalted victims consider all dream-spent motes Peripheral as they subconsciously flare their animas. All Willpower and Virtue channels spent are actually spent. All mental influence imposed in the dream carries over to reality for its full duration. No physical harm carries over, but if the victim is killed in the dream, the Charm ends for both parties without breaking the tag.</p>
<p>Dying inside the dream feels like actually dying, so the experience drains five additional Willpower points from the victim and counts as a scene spent building an Intimacy of fear toward the Infernal. If this results in the Intimacy actually taking root or bolstering an existing Intimacy of fear, nothing can remove it until a week has gone by since the victim awoke from the dream. Beings with a Limit track can gain equivalent points of Limit in lieu of losing any of the Willpower. Victims can choose to quickly commit suicide within the nightmare to escape it with minimal loss, but doing so causes the Intimacy of fear to form immediately rather counting as a scene toward it.</p>
<p>If the victim&rsquo;s real body suffers any levels of damage during the dream, the Charm abruptly ends for both parties. This also happens if the Charm runs its full duration without being interrupted. Both dreamers leave the dream with the Infernal no worse for the wear and the victim depleted by her exertions within the dreamscape. The tag remains, but the dream does not hurt the victim&rsquo;s psyche like virtual death.</p>
<p>Victims of Armageddon Nightmare Duel leave the nightmare acutely aware of the Infernal Monster Style Charms the Exalt displayed. Those who are capable of learning Celestial Martial Arts from a teacher can instruct themselves in any of the Charms they observed as though the Infernal was their teacher. Obviously, only other Infernals can learn Infernal Monster expansions this way without an effect like the Eclipse anima power. Characters requiring a special initiation before they can learn Celestial Martial Arts (like Dragon-Blooded) cannot learn Charms from exposure to Armageddon Nightmare Duel until they undergo that initiation.</p>
<p>Players who purchase this Charm for their characters are expected to use it to create additional interesting scenes, not steal the spotlight. It is poor form to hold a game hostage to play out a personal fight. If the outcome isn&rsquo;t really in doubt and the both dreamers&rsquo; players consent, a quick narrative of the one-sided brawl suffices in lieu of devoting an entire scene to the duel. Standing and fighting the Infernal in quick narration rather than jumping off a cliff may be equally futile, but at least the Intimacy of fear forms less quickly.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Those who have earned Adorjan&rsquo;s deepest regard may be graced with her most sacred gift—silence. This Charm may be invoked to supplement a kiss; if the target is an unwilling recipient of the Infernal&rsquo;s affections, this requires a clinch attempt (the kiss itself may be treated as a hold action if desired, though a crush attack is just as effective; so long as the Infernal draws in her victim&rsquo;s breath, the state of the rest of his body is of little consequence). With a quick inhalation of breath, the Infernal steals her victim&rsquo;s voice. Though not actually damaging, the process is momentarily but excruciatingly painful; coughing up a few drops of blood is a common aftereffect.</p>
<p>For as long as the Infernal commits Essence to maintain the Charm, she may speak in the voice she has stolen. Releasing the commitment of Essence returns the stolen voice to its proper owner. At Essence 4+, she gains the ability terminate the Charm by swallowing a stolen voice entirely, which nourishes her as if it were a corpse inhaled with Sacred Kamilla&rsquo;s Inhalation (or, optionally, as though it were the death of an extra, if the Infernal knows <a class="complex" href="murder-is-meat.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Murder Is Meat'"><span class="link-focus">Murder is Meat</span></a>). If the voice belonged to a mortal, that mortal is rendered permanently mute. If it belonged to a supernatural being, that being is rendered mute for one week per dot of the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence before finally regaining his voice.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm, at Essence 4+, gives the Infernal the option to let a stolen voice&rsquo;s owner telepathically hear the words she speaks with it regardless of the distance between them (provided they are in the same realm of existence). This may even be used to make social attacks against the voice&rsquo;s original owner. Shutting the stolen voice out for a day costs one Willpower. This can be done as soon as communication begins to minimize the victim&rsquo;s risk. If a victim doesn&rsquo;t shut out words that turn out to be a social attack, it is too late to block that attack via immunity. The victim must first resolve the social attack before spending an extra Willpower to shut out the stolen voice.</p>

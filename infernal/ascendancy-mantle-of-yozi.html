        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Primordials did not wait to exert their will over Creation and the crashing maelstroms of the Wyld at its shores, their authority rooted in the elegant ecology of superior might. The Green Sun Princes now emulate this splendor with a Charm of their devising, hastening their growth toward unknowable transcendence.</p>
<p>As a permanent upgrade, the Infernal can spend experience to buy his Essence rating up to a dot higher than his age should permit (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 275). Each version of this Charm carries a different drawback depending on the Yozi used as a springboard for enlightenment. These drawbacks persist only as long as the character&rsquo;s Essence rating is higher than it could be without this Charm. Upon reaching the age that Essence 10 is naturally available, the Infernal replaces this Charm with another of his choice. Characters may only learn a single Ascendancy Mantle of (Yozi).</p>
<p><strong>Malfeas:</strong> The first five boxes of the Infernal&rsquo;s Limit track are always full.</p>
<p><strong>Cecelyne:</strong> This Charm is Messianic (Cult 4). If the Infernal&rsquo;s Cult rating drops below this threshold, he loses all benefit from his excess Essence dot (high-Essence Charms, superhuman Attributes and Abilities, larger Essence pool, etc) while he has Cult 3 or less.</p>
<p><strong>She Who Lives in Her Name:</strong> The Whispering Flame is unforgiving of deviation from proper purpose. When the character commits an Act of Villainy to mitigate Limit, he rolls only one die, regardless of his Virtue ratings.</p>
<p><strong>Adorjan:</strong> When the Infernal violates his Urge, he automatically gains (Essence) points of Limit rather than rolling.</p>
<p><strong>Ebon Dragon:</strong> The Ebon Dragon&rsquo;s hollow Essence pervades the warlock, rendering him incapable of channeling Virtues.</p>
<p><strong>Kimbery:</strong> This Charm has the Sea Keyword. While not in proximity to a sea, the Infernal loses all benefit from excess Essence (similar to Cecelyne).</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The warlock must retreat from the world to learn this Charm. For one season, she must surround herself only with those things which are steeped in her Essence—her attuned artifacts, her bound demons and nothing more. Concentrating inward, she drives the enormous power of the conflicting forces she has mastered against one another, with her Essence caught between them. Much as the Yozis reconfigure their akuma, she redefines the parameters of her mutilated Exaltation, crafting something more to her liking.</p>
<p>Upon learning this Charm, the warlock partially redesigns her Caste. Her iconic anima display changes to become representative of herself rather than her unwoven coadjutor, in the manner of the Solar Exalted (though its predominating imagery is still that of Hell, not the glorious heroes of the sun). Her anima banner itself may be radically transformed, having different cosmetic effects on objects exposed to it; it may even shine some color other than green (though it will never identically mimic the anima display of some other variety of Exalted). She designs a new caste mark for herself.</p>
<p>Moreover, she discards her old anima power, replacing it with a new one designed by her player and the Storyteller and matched to the character&rsquo;s personal aptitudes and talents. Use existing anima powers as a creation guideline.</p>
<p>These transformations are permanent for the warlock, but not extensive enough to endure into her next incarnation. Her Exaltation restores itself to the base template mandated by the Yozis upon death. All changes brought about by this Charm must be approved by the Storyteller.</p>
<p>The two Shintai prerequisites must be from different Yozi.</p>

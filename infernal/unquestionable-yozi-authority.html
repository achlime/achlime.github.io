        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Yozis transcend all lesser aspects of themselves. While active, this Charm exerts an unnatural compulsion against demons with a lower Essence rating, preventing them from making any physical attacks that would knowingly target or risk obvious immediate harm to the Infernal, even in self-defense. The compulsion does not deter demons forced to attack by sorcerous binding, however. Demons with an Essence rating one dot lower than the Infernal may overcome this Compulsion for a scene by paying one Willpower, allowing them to attack freely during that time. Demons of lesser Essence can&rsquo;t muster resistance. Hostile demons can work around this Charm to an extent. An area attack that encompasses the Infernal&rsquo;s location is forbidden, since this would cause obvious immediate harm, but attacking a cliff to catch the Infernal in a rockslide is acceptable, since the rockslide is an indirect consequence of the attack that triggered it. Once an Infernal has Essence 6+, the cost to activate this Charm reduces to zero motes, and demons of equal Essence are affected by a resistible compulsion (and those with one dot less can no longer resist). Even demons of equal Essence lose the opportunity to resist once the Infernal has Essence 8+.</p>
<p>Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 4+ extends its effects to gods as though they were demons. All the usual loopholes apply, which is how the bravest gods aided the Exalted during the Primordial War.</p>

            <p>Kimbery&rsquo;s vanity does not allow her to waste time sleeping that she could spend contemplating her own virtue. Lost in dreams, she might miss a prayer of gratitude for her benevolence. This Charm provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each full hour submerged counts as rest for Essence respiration, regardless of exertion. Surfacing for a quick breath doesn&rsquo;t disrupt submergence, though surfacing for any other reason does.</li>
<li>Spending an hour praying to herself or Kimbery while submerged in a sea and making a successful prayer roll lets her respire 20 motes.</li>
<li>Spending (8 – Essence, minimum 1) hours meditating while submerged provides all benefits of sleeping eight hours.</li>
<li>She can speak Old Realm while submerged and her words carry as well as through air. Her dialect is that of the ancient Lintha, the holy inflection Kimbery seared into the principle of liquid during Creation&rsquo;s genesis.</li>
<li>She can verbally pray to any being who knows <a class="complex" href="first-kimbery-excellency.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'First Kimbery Excellency'"><span class="link-focus">First Kimbery Excellency</span></a> with a prayer at -1 target number as a Shaping effect, provided the target and her are both submerged in a sea at the time of the prayer. Secret currents between all seas carry the words to the target&rsquo;s mind even if she can&rsquo;t normally hear prayers.</li>
</ul>

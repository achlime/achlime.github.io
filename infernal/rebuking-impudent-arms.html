        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In the time before time, weapons knew their place, and even the sharpest blades dulled lest they scratch the King of the Primordials where he tread. The passing of Ages has diminished the world, but arsenals may yet be reminded of their place. This Charm can enhance any disarm attempt within the range limit of Green Sun Nimbus Flare. If the attack hits, the weapon superheats and glows brilliant green as if Ligier held it. Mortal weapons melt into slag or crumble to ash on the spot. Artifact weapons and those formed entirely of Essence are unharmed but remain superheated for a minute afterward, increasing the difficulty of the wielder&rsquo;s roll to resist the disarm attempt by 2.</p>
<p>Anyone holding a superheated weapon suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage per action of contact (or fraction thereof). If the wielder forgoes the roll to maintain control and drops the superheated weapon immediately or that weapon is vaporized, he suffers no damage. Because the fire ignited by Rebuking Impudent Arms burns through Yozi power rather than heat alone, flame-resistant adversaries have as much to fear from this Charm as anyone else. Appropriate countermagic can cool a heated artifact back to normal temperature.</p>

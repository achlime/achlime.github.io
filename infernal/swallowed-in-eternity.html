        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Though savants marvel that Cecelyne&rsquo;s vast expanse may be crossed in only five days, the truth is that if the Endless Desert wills it, she may stretch her roads out to infinity. Expressing this principle, the Infernal holds her hand out, palm-first, toward a single opponent. This is treated as a Blockade Movement action, though the Infernal rolls (Willpower + Cult) in place of ([Strength or Dexterity] + Athletics). Should the Infernal win this contest, her target is rendered unable to approach her for the duration of the Charm. The landscape between warlock and pursuer stretches out infinitely, and although the target perceives himself to be moving, no amount of exertion on his part can close the distance between the two. To observers, the area around the target seems to confusingly sprawl outward without limit, but does not actually move him away from any other individuals or objects. This Charm cannot be used on a single opponent more than once per action.</p>
<p>This Charm only functions in places of desolation. Using this Charm within the sands of Cecelyne or a region blighted by <a class="complex" href="holy-land-infliction.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Holy Land Infliction'"><span class="link-focus">Holy Land Infliction</span></a> (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Infernals</strong>, p. 125) allows the Infernal to enhance her activation roll with the Excellencies of Cecelyne.</p>
<p>Swallowed in Eternity adds (Essence) dice to the roll-off against conflicting effects such as <a class="complex" href="../martial-arts/eternal-infatuation-dance.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Eternal Infatuation Dance'"><span class="link-focus">Eternal Infatuation Dance</span></a> (see <strong>Glories of the Most High—The Maidens of Destiny</strong>, p. 28).</p>

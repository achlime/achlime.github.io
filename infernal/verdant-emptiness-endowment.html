        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Few beings are as they would choose to be. Certainly, Cecelyne would rather that her inner borders were not fettered to Malfeas. Where dissatisfaction endures, emptiness spreads the idea of the Endless Desert. Prior to using this Charm, the character must have observed the target express dislike of her present state and desire for some improvement of natural aptitude or training, such as beauty or skill with a sword. The wish need not be articulated with any intention of seeking its fulfillment or even seriously, but it must be unambiguous. In this condition is met, the Infernal need only be within (Essence) yards of the target and activate Verdant Emptiness Endowment. Doing so causes the target to gain one dot of the Attribute, Ability or specialty that best pertains to the observed wish. This Training effect can&rsquo;t raise any trait above its normal maximum, nor does the Infernal need any rating in a trait to bestow it. This Charm also can&rsquo;t target those who have any outstanding experience debt from prior use of any Training effect.</p>
<p>It is possible for the target to unconsciously reject the gift for a cost of one Willpower, thereby avoiding the gift and its hidden price tag. This effect is not Obvious, however, so the target&rsquo;s player only knows the trait being offered and the associated experience cost, without learning anything about the source of the effect or the price. Once the gift is accepted, the magic is done, and countermagic can&rsquo;t reverse it.</p>
<p>Traits improved by this Charm do so over the course of the scene, fast enough to be miraculous but slow enough that no one has to know the source of the blessing. The Yozis always exact a price for their gifts, however. At any point in the future, the Infernal may come back to that individual and demand any one task. If the target understands the demand and the task isn&rsquo;t literally impossible, she intuitively understands that doom will befall her for failing to obey. After one month or as soon as the task becomes impossible (or constitutes an unacceptable order), the duty ends without harm to the beneficiary. However, if the character stops working toward the goal for more than a day while the duty remains, she suffers a number of automatic botches equal to the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence rating. These botches match the effects of breaking an oath sanctified by an Eclipse Caste Solar and linger until the worst possible time. It is possible to target oneself with the Charm, in which case the Infernal obviously owes himself nothing.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is fortunate that the Unconquered Sun took Creation from Malfeas, rather than forcing him to give it to the gods. Otherwise, all might burn to ash. To activate this Charm, the Infernal focuses his wrath on some non-magical object or structure that he once owned and deliberately gave to another individual. Wherever that object is in any realm of existence, it chars in a flash of emerald fire, leaving only a hardened statue of coal roughly half the size of the item and only vaguely shaped in its likeness. The statue crumbles with the lightest force (Soak 0B/0L; 1 level of damage needed to obliterate it to black dust). If the target belongs to a Celestial Exalt, the Infernal must make a Willpower roll at a difficulty of the owner&rsquo;s Essence to destroy the object; failure permanently immunizes the gift against the warlock&rsquo;s wrath. Malfeas long ago destroyed all in Creation that he could burn with this Charm. All that remains is beyond his power to touch.</p>
<p>The fire unleashed by this Charm does not harm anything other than the intended target, so a sword burnt to ash does not sear the hand that holds it. The blast is an unblockable and undodgeable attack against the bearer of the target item and can be defended against as such.</p>
<p>With Essence 5+, the Infernal may destroy magical items he gave to others, but only if he created those items himself or oversaw the team of workers that built them (as in the case of most manses).</p>
<p>A repurchase at Essence 6+ allows the Infernal to obliterate any number of valid targets of this Charm within a 10 mile radius, setting the epicenter up to (Essence x 10) miles away.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Ebon Dragon would choose almost any end to conflict over a glorious last stand. Though he loathes putting himself at risk, he knows the price of surrender. This Charm allows a Fiend to modify its prerequisite, paying an extra 10 motes upon activation to set the stage for a terrifying showdown. The Infernal must activate this effect in an enclosed space no larger than (Essence x 10) yards in radius. Enclosed means four walls, a ceiling (or other substantial overhead cover, such as a dome), and a floor. The Storyteller should not be overly precise in interpreting these parameters: the presence of windows, doors, or holes in the structure do not disqualify the use of this Charm. Before the sun&rsquo;s birth, the Ebon Dragon dwelt in cracks and the spaces between things, and he still holds dominion in these places. Characters wishing to bolt themselves into deep cracks or caves may gain this Charm&rsquo;s effects in spite of the gaping entrance which fronts one side of the enclosure. The Storyteller should follow the spirit of this Charm more than the letter.</p>
<p>Nothing is so dangerous as a dragon in its lair. This is especially true of the Ebon Dragon. The pitch black field within the enclosure has all the same statistics as the prerequisite, with the following additional effects: the darkness within this enclosure cannot be penetrated by natural light. Magical light sources strobe unnaturally, giving a hollow white effusion that produces only half the usual intensity. Shadows thrown by such light are always horrific, menacing intruders in the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair. But enemies of the warlock should be thankful to ever see them.</p>
<p>For the duration of the effect, the Fiend is aware of the exact position of anyone standing in the pall of Dragon&rsquo;s Lair Obtenebration, and may strike them at any distance, so long as both the warlock and his targets remain within the confines of the shadow. The Fiend may attack such targets as if he were standing right beside them, and may pick any angle for the attack, making cover completely impossible. Additionally, the first time any character emerges into the field of darkness, the Fiend is aware of it and may make an immediate unexpected reflexive attack against that character.</p>
<p>The Essence 6+ range expansion of Noon as Night Evocation does not apply to Dragon&rsquo;s Lair Obtenebration until Essence 8.</p>

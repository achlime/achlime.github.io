        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal presents his palm or caste mark toward an opponent within five yards and emits a blinding discharge of Essence from that point. Make an opposed roll of the warlock&rsquo;s (Dexterity + War) against the victim&rsquo;s (Wits + Awareness). If the Infernal wins, he chooses an opportune tactical moment and successfully blinds his target, searing the image of his iconic anima into her mind&rsquo;s eye. Otherwise, the target blinks or looks away just in time and is unaffected.</p>
<p>Until the victim takes a diceless miscellaneous action to rub her eyes and blink fresh tears over the flashburn, she is as blind as if both her eyes had been removed (see Exalted, p. 152). The Infernal also applies a +3 relative Appearance bonus when making social attacks against a character fully blinded by this Charm from the afterimage of his anima, regardless of actual Appearance ratings involved. Cleaning out one&rsquo;s eyes is delicate work; the action can&rsquo;t be part of a non-magical flurry. Even after a character restores her sight, she still suffers a -1 internal penalty to all vision-based Perception rolls for the rest of the day. This penalty is not cumulative with successive applications of Tarnish Flash Technique.</p>

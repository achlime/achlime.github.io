        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is the nature of She Who Lives In Her Name to understand all patterns less than herself. To use this Charm, an Infernal chooses a sapient being within (Willpower x 10) yards. The target experiences sudden phantom pain as though from vivisection and knows that some external force seeks to invade her mind, but not who. Roll the Infernal&rsquo;s (Perception + Investigation + Essence) as a social attack against the target&rsquo;s MDV. If no successes are rolled, the Infernal loses an additional one Willpower from the frustration of inconceivable failure. If successful, the Infernal mentally probes the target&rsquo;s mind and learns the answer to one question of his choice. The victim does not experience the probe as a question per se, but understands the intent of the intrusion and relives flashes of rapid-fire memories that the Infernal simultaneously experiences and interprets. The defender&rsquo;s player supplies the answer and must do so truthfully without meaningful omissions, as enforced by the Storyteller. The defender may spend one Willpower to ignore the unnatural mental influence of that probe attempt or three Willpower to gain total immunity to all uses of this Charm for the rest of the scene. Victims of Analytical Modeling Intuition do not have to reveal any information about their emotional state and may take a &ldquo;just the facts&rdquo; approach to keep such details private. Forcing a character to relive painful or humiliating memories is extremely stressful, imposing a -2 internal penalty on the victim&rsquo;s next roll to regain Willpower from sleep. This penalty does not cumulatively worsen with repeated exposure.</p>
<p>With a second purchase of this Charm, the Infernal may touch an inanimate object to rip answers from the object&rsquo;s least god. No roll is required, nor can the god resist, but the Exalt only learns information he could glean with a threshold of five successes on a successful Investigation roll at any difficulty. Least gods only perceive events that directly relate to their limited domain, so the information they have is likewise limited. Finally, use of this Charm to rip experiences out of a least god&rsquo;s mind sends the deity into quivering catatonia for an hour, preventing it from being interrogated again during this time.</p>
<p>A third purchase of this Charm reduces the activation cost to one mote if the Infernal targeted the same person using Analytical Modeling Intuition on his last action. Failure to continuously renew the effect or choosing a new target resets the Charm&rsquo;s usual cost.</p>

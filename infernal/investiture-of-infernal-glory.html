        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The first step in the target&rsquo;s damnation must be made by the target herself, who must begin the process with a prayer to her future Yozi patron, offering her body, soul and mind to the fulfillment of that Yozi&rsquo;s desire. This prayer has a difficulty of only 1, but it must be accompanied by the expenditure of a permanent Willpower point from the future akuma. The mere act of performing this blasphemous prayer taints the target&rsquo;s personal destiny so utterly that, if the ritual is begun within Creation&rsquo;s borders, it may trigger an alert within the Loom of Fate and an immediate response from Yu-Shan. For this reason, both the akuma and the demon employing the Charm generally retire to someplace outside of Fate, usually Malfeas but occasionally Wyld zones or even shadowlands. If the prayer roll is successful, the Yozi is persuaded of the petitioner&rsquo;s sincerity and authorizes the activation of the Charm.</p>
<p>Once the Charm is initiated, the akuma-to-be is wracked with agonizing pain as pure vitriol from Hell&rsquo;s heart pours into her body, warping and reshaping it to suit her patron&rsquo;s twisted aesthetic. Nor are her mind and soul safe. The process reconfigures and re-edits the akuma&rsquo;s life experiences, cutting her memories apart and reshaping them like the artistry of a demented child. This phase of the process takes several torturous hours and requires the restructuring of the akuma&rsquo;s body, soul and mind. Every positive experience from the akuma&rsquo;s childhood might be twisted into a memory of horrific abuse in order to reduce her Compassion and harden her Conviction and Valor. Her entire body might literally be turned inside out to better allow the demon to rearrange her musculature to convert Appearance into Strength or Dexterity. A lifetime&rsquo;s experience spent sailing the high seas might be stripped away in order to make room for better skill with a sword.</p>
<p>What comes next is even worse. While the physical and mental changes are achieved in just a few hours, the akuma must now spend days suffering the rape of his soul, as his personal Essence is extracted, alloyed with vitriol and then restored to his body. In addition to tainting his Essence with the resonance of the Yozi, the akuma also suffers a total loss of self. Oh, he retains his former sentience, after a fashion. But a newly forged akuma loses the ability to choose a destiny for himself (as reflected in most beings by a Motivation). Instead, an akuma sacrifices his Motivation and gains an Urge defined by the akuma&rsquo;s patron. Although similar to that of a Green Sun Prince, the Urge of an akuma has many important differences, which are described beginning on page 54.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Benefits</strong>: From an out-of-character perspective, the Investiture of Infernal Glory is much easier to explain. Basically, once the Charm is successfully used, the akuma&rsquo;s former character Traits (including Attributes, Abilities, Virtues, Willpower and even Charms, but not Backgrounds) may be converted into experience points. The number of experience points a Trait would yield is equal to the number of experience points it would cost to purchase it. That is, if the Yozi patron reduced a newly acquired akuma&rsquo;s Appearance from four dots to two, the reduction would yield 20 experience points (the eight points it would normally cost to raise the character&rsquo;s Appearance from two to three dots, plus the 12 points it would normally cost to raise it from three dots to four). Theoretically, the Yozi patron can reduce any Trait to zero. In practice, however, it is pointless to go to the trouble of creating an akuma who is crippled in some way by the process. It is rare for a Yozi to reduce any Virtue to 1 or less (except for Appearance) and almost unheard of to reduce one of an akuma&rsquo;s Virtues that low. It is unusual to reduce an akuma&rsquo;s Willpower at all—since all akuma are preternaturally loyal to their Yozi masters, it behooves a Yozi to make its akuma as &ldquo;tamper proof&rdquo; as possible against others who would seek to manipulate them.</p>
<p>Once the character&rsquo;s Traits have been converted into experience, those experience points may be spent however the Yozi wishes at the normal experience point cost for the type of being the akuma was before her damnation. An Exalted akuma treats all Charms associated with her Yozi patron as in-caste or in-aspect Charms as appropriate for her Exalted type and continues to treat all formerly in-caste or in-aspect Charms, Abilities and/or Attributes as such. If the akuma was not Exalted, she will instead pay 15 experience points for each Yozi Charm purchased. The trait cap for an akuma is one dot higher than it normally would be. Thus, an akuma with Essence 1-5 can have up to six dots in a trait, while an akuma with Essence 6 could go up to seven dots.</p>
<p>The infusion of demonic energy during the second phase both augments the akuma further and also marks him forever more as a creature of the Yozis. The akuma immediately gains the benefits of Demonic Patron 5 and Demonic Inheritance 5 (see pp. 61 and 62). The latter Background also confers additional experience points that may be spent on the character. If the akuma was not already an Essence wielder, he automatically gains the benefits of the Awakened Essence abomination (see p. 63) and acquires an Essence pool equal to (Essence x 5) + (Willpower x 2) + (sum of Virtues). The akuma respires Essence in both Creation and Malfeas, just as a Green Sun Prince does.</p>
<p>The final mechanical step is the permanent erasure of the akuma&rsquo;s former Motivation and its replacement with an Urge appropriate to his Yozi patron. Unlike the Green Sun Princes, an akuma has no means of modifying an Urge that is no longer viable. Thus, once an akuma&rsquo;s Urge is set, it can only be altered by another painful application of this Charm. Worse, since the akuma&rsquo;s current Urge is his defining motive for existence, it is very difficult to persuade an akuma to agree to the Investiture again. Accordingly, most akuma Urges are fairly broad in scope, as akuma cursed with more narrow Urges often go mad from the frustration of a goal that has become impossible. Akuma Urges are discussed more fully beginning below.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The most important such safeguard is the Charm can never be learned or used by any god or elemental of Creation, nor can it be learned by any type of Exalt (including Eclipse and Moonshadow Castes) unless the Exalt is already an akuma.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the akuma themselves know it either. Having learned the bitter lessons of treachery at the hands of rebellious underlings, the Yozis have not repeated past errors by teaching their newest slaves the means to create akuma slaves of their own. It is unknown whether the Green Sun Princes are similarly barred from learning this Charm—in the short span since their creation, none of the 50 Princes has mastered it.</p>

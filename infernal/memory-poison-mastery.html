        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With greater attunement to the Ebon Dragon comes greater power to attack the sanctity of treasured memories. The slight catch is that power is slavery. Those who can sabotage memories adroitly find themselves compelled to do so. This Charm permanently modifies its prerequisite as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social attack enhanced by the Charm adds a number of bonus dice equal to the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence. These are dice added by a Charm and count toward those limits.</li>
<li>The base cost to heal memories damaged by each activation of this Charm increases to three Willpower. If the memory corrupted a positive Intimacy, the cost rises even further to (Infernal&rsquo;s Essence rating, maximum five) Willpower. The victim still can only spend Willpower to heal a memory in the moment the Infernal attacks or in response to plausible prompting (such as encountering evidence that contradicts recollection).</li>
<li>Upon overhearing a non-extra speaking of a treasured memory, the Infernal must use his next available action to attack the memory with Golden Years Tarnished Black unless he can&rsquo;t pay the cost to do so. He may use the Charm any way he knows how (such as creating an addiction via Want Becomes Need) and needn&rsquo;t stick to just ruining memories. If he doesn&rsquo;t attack the memory in question, he gains a point of Limit unless he has already gained Limit this way previously in the day. This mad need to taint others doesn&rsquo;t apply if the Infernal has no opportunity to react that way. Limit is not gained from hearing a memory relayed by an Infallible Messenger sent halfway around the world. Likewise, Limit isn&rsquo;t gained if the Infernal can&rsquo;t make social attacks for any reason, such as due to being bound and gagged. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the final arbiter, but should consider whether the character made a good faith effort to attack a cherished memory when given a reasonable chance to do so.</li>

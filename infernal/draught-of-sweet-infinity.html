        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>From time to time, the sands of the Endless Desert swell and burst apart, releasing a faint gust of perfumed wind, sweet and spicy and full of promise of benevolence not fitting to the Demon Realm. Those meant to breathe such grace do so five days hence, and by the power of Cecelyne, cripples may walk and the blind may see—the better that they walk into the sands of eternity and behold her infinite splendor.</p>
<p>This Charm is a permanent enhancement of its prerequisite, allowing the Infernal to grant the expressed desires of others for healing, though she may not heal herself. It is even possible to grant a wish that is not communicated, but intended (as defined by the target&rsquo;s player), such as a coma patient&rsquo;s desire to wake. Five days before bearing witness to such a request, a perfumed breath escapes the warlock&rsquo;s lips unnoticed by her or anyone else—it is the faintest of sighs. And yet, in the place and moment for which the breath was intended, it takes root within the flesh of the beneficiary as a great blessing.</p>
<p>The power of this Charm can instantly mend any single Crippling injury in the blink of an eye, or heal (warlock&rsquo;s Essence or Cult) non-aggravated damage levels the target currently suffers. Having accepted the blessing, the target instantly develops an Intimacy of reverence toward the Infernal (or shifts the context of any existing Intimacy to reverence), and this natural Emotion effect cannot be further resisted due to the target&rsquo;s acceptance.</p>
<p>There are limits to Cecelyne&rsquo;s power, if not to herself. Once a target has received healing from this Charm, he cannot be healed again until five days pass. Only during Calibration does this restriction ease, during which targets may be healed as often as the Infernal chooses to activate Verdant Emptiness Endowment for the cause and pays full cost to do so (no activation cost discounts may be applied).</p>
<p>With Essence 4+, a single activation can mend one Crippling wound and heal damage (rather than having to choose). Essence 5+ allows the healing of all Crippling wounds and appropriate damage levels, but doing so adds a surcharge of four motes per Crippling wound past the first.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Creation was built to reflect the glorious order embodied by She Who Lives In Her Name, from the movement of the constellations to the closed circle of life and death. Taking up the least expression of the Pyrian Flame&rsquo;s perfect motion, the Infernal becomes a reflection of this truth.</p>
<p>Upon activating Orbital Impact Storm, the warlock seizes a clattering maelstrom of loose objects from the surrounding environment— stones and chairs, dinner plates, hammers, broken fence-posts, and any other nearby bric-a-brac (objects carried by individuals and all attuned artifacts are exempt from being appropriated in this manner, as are objects too large or heavy for the average adult mortal to lift with one hand). If necessary, the Infernal may even rip cobblestones loose from streets or bricks from walls, inflicting (Essence) levels of unsoakable damage in the process; objects and structures with a soak greater than 8L are immune to such vandalism. This Charm cannot be activated if the Storyteller decrees that the environment lacks appropriate objects to work with, though players are reminded that two-point stunts allow dramatic editing of the scenery.</p>
<p>The seized objects hang in midair for a moment. Then the newly-formed constellation of debris begins to orbit the Infernal at ever-increasing speeds, pulverizing those foolish enough to attempt to close with the warlock. This constitutes an environmental hazard (Damage 4L/action, Trauma 2) covering a sphere with a radius of (Essence) yards around the character. Even blunt objects inflict lethal damage at the speed generated by Orbital Impact Storm. Opponents may safely navigate the storm if their Dodge DV is higher than the Infernal&rsquo;s (Willpower x 2). Additionally, it becomes difficult to target the Infernal through the whirling maelstrom, as blades are knocked askew and arrows snapped in half before they can reach her flesh; attacks suffer an external penalty of (Infernal&rsquo;s Essence ÷ 2, round up).</p>
<p>Normally, action-interval environmental hazard exposure resolves after the victim&rsquo;s DV refreshes but before anyone acts on the tick. However, the storm created by this Charm damages victims after resolving all actions taken during the tick, meaning that characters agile enough to avoid the debris must take care not to penalize their Dodge DV to the point that they get hit.</p>
<p>Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, the warlock may deactivate Orbital Impact Storm voluntarily. This may be done peacefully with a diceless miscellaneous action, freezing the suspended objects in place a split second before dropping them. Alternately, she can reflexively pay 5 motes to hurl shrapnel in all directions as a one-time environmental hazard (Damage 5L, Trauma 3) with a radius of (Willpower x 5) yards. This terminates the Charm and does not count as a Charm activation. Opponents may avoid the debris outright if their Dodge DV is higher than the Infernal&rsquo;s (Willpower + Essence).</p>
<p>Essence 3+ Infernals can purchase this Charm a second time, extending its duration to one day (or indefinite with Essence 5+).</p>

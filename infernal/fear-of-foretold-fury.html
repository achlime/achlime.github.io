        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the outcome is a given, trauma precedes horror. Those who stand in the presence of the Infernal Monster know this. This Charm permanently improves its prerequisite. By spending an additional Willpower to activate Post-Traumatic Brutality Roar, the cry penalizes all military units within a mile (whether or not they have engaged with the Infernal in the past day).</p>
<p>With Essence 5+, using Fear of Foretold Fury affects all units in full earshot distance (Limit +1 miles). The trauma also magically carries to all units in the same realm of existence who have ever engaged with the Infernal as a solo unit, provided they retained consistent unit identity and leadership since that battle. The Storyteller determines if a unit has undergone sufficient turnover or shift in identity that it no longer recalls the horror of that fight. Gradual replacement of the rank-and-file does not erode the impact of the experience. Grizzled veterans pass along the whispered horror stories to wide-eyed recruits. Some refuse to talk about That Day at all. They just scowl and drink and look nervously behind them. A unit leader can address the lingering damage from the experience by taking the time to reassure the ranks and inspire them. This convalescence extends the time required to perform a restorative rally to a dramatic action lasting one week (ten hours a day); the leader must pay five Willpower to make the roll at the end. If the rally succeeds, the unit is no longer scarred and can&rsquo;t be affected outside of the (Limit +1 mile) radius until they have another actual battle with the Infernal.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Each syllable of the name in which the Principle of Hierarchy dwells encodes the birth or unraveling of the universe, a weapon of sublime perfection. By superimposing a syllable of that word over the pattern of her body, an Infernal with this Charm unravels herself into perfect crystal geometries of force and motion resembling the Pyrian Source in miniature. She may embrace this form or choose another, rebuilding her component constellations into any imagined shape that fits within a (Essence x 100) yard radius—most commonly herself surrounded by a storm of spheres. Ultimately, all permutations provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Myriad crystal orbs and semi-tangible light constructs comprise her reimagined body, leaving her without means of parrying, physically manipulating her environment, or physically attacking by most means. She can dodge normally. Her natural soak and hardness increases to 10L/B (if lower) and and she gains +20B/20L soak.</li>
<li>She does not need to eat, drink, or breathe while in this form.</li>
<li>Her constellations levitate and fly as though using Ascendant Objectivity Stance.</li>
<li>She can use Principle-Invoking Onslaught as an innate power rather than a Charm activation, paying nothing to do so. She has no limit on the number of independent clinches she can maintain.</li>
<li>Her effective Strength with <a class="complex" href="mind-hand-manipulation.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Mind-Hand Manipulation'"><span class="link-focus">Mind-Hand Manipulation</span></a> triples, the range of her telekinesis increases to (Essence x 300) yards and the rate of telekinetic striking attacks rises to 10. She can choose for telekinetic attacks to encompass an entire complementary unit in mass combat, systematically sweeping through the ranks with cold efficiency. This doubles the raw damage of the attack and ensures that all casualties lost to it can be killed, permitted to desert or maimed as the Infernal dictates.</li>
<li>She isn&rsquo;t required to inflict damage to substitute Willpower drain for damage via Will-Crushing Force. Instead, she can make this swap any time she hits. Further, she can attack complementary units this way, in which case Willpower drain applies separately to all members and is simultaneously tracked as an aggregate total against the unit. Once the total reaches the highest Willpower rating for all mortal members, these characters dissolve in white flame and are replaced with soulless copies. If the majority of the unit is converted, it ejects unconverted members and must reorganize its ranks accordingly.</li>
</ul>

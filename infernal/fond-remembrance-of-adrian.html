        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When she encircled Creation as the River of Torments, Adrián formed a moat of fire, ice and razors to fence out the Unshaped nuisances that pestered the Primordials. Raksha who dared test her borders found her not so much impregnable as annihilating, shredding the works of their Shaping like cobwebs before ravaging them with her elements. Adrián is long dead, but Adorjan still remembers how to punish those who would make her other than herself. This Charm may be activated as a defense against any Shaping effect that targets the Infernal or any owned objects within (Compassion x 5) yards. Not only does Fond Remembrance of Adrián negate that effect in a violent spray of jagged Essence, but the being who used that Shaping effect suffers an automatically successful attack that inflicts (Conviction)L dice of damage from simultaneous laceration, incineration and deep freezing. The damage becomes aggravated once the Infernal attains Essence 6+. When no clear perpetrator can be identified for punishment, Adorjan&rsquo;s torments draw silent screams from the shinma instead.</p>
<p>The protection afforded by this Charm lasts as long as the Infernal commits Essence to it. One-time Shaping effects shatter against the Charm&rsquo;s power, while mutagenic environments like the Wyld require continuous protection. The retaliatory damage pulse only occurs when Fond Remembrance of Adrián first activates, however, providing an incentive to reactivate this Charm if opponents press the point. Each active instance of this Charm defends against all Shaping effects from a single source. A valid source need not be present, but must exist (so resistance to the warping power of the Wyld lasts for the duration of commitment, even if the character leaves the Wyld).</p>

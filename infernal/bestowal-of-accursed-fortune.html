        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm expands the scope of its prerequisite, Verdant Emptiness Endowment, allowing that Charm to bestow dots of certain Backgrounds as an alternative to other traits. These dots take a number of weeks equal to the character&rsquo;s new rating in the raised Background to appear and do so through a strange conjunction of coincidences that appear implausible but well within the bounds of possibility. Even as pattern spiders chitter impotent protests at the disruption, they find the pattern of good fortune tangled into their work and have no choice but to integrate the foreign design or damage the Tapestry even worse. This Charm can&rsquo;t bestow Backgrounds on a character while a previously bestowed dot is pending resolution.</p>
<p>The beneficiary does not even have to begin paying for the dot until it is received. As a Training effect, each Background dot provided by this Charm costs three experience points.</p>
<p>The Backgrounds that may be improved by this Charm are as follows: Abyssal Command, Allies, Acquaintances, Backing, Command, Connections, Contacts, Cult, Followers, Henchmen, Influence, Mentor, Resources, Reputation, Retainers, Salary, Sifu and Spies. Some of these Backgrounds may be found in the various Manuals of Exalted Power. Any other selections require express Storyteller approval and must pertain to some form of social advantage rather than anything more innate or supernatural. Targets of this Charm may not be given Backgrounds they are normally unable to possess for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Infernals can improve their own social standing with this Charm. If they are doing so to restore previously attained ratings in the Backgrounds that were lost without any experience point recompense or other restitution (as determined by the Storyteller), there is no experience cost associated with the regained dot. The benefit does not apply unless the previous ratings in question were paid for, whether through initial Background dots, bonus points or experience. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; Backgrounds awarded through plot events remain ineligible until they have been fully paid for (three experience points per dot).</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Tragedy inspires the best in people. The weak graciously perish to make way for the strong, who rise above opposition and adversity to achieve greatness and ultimately perpetuate that hardship upon their enemies. Only Adorjan fully understands the importance of inauspicious events to the workings of fate, save perhaps for Jupiter whose nature prevents her from explaining her insights to the other Maidens. This Charm expresses the Adorjani hope that all of Creation will one day understand the elegant necessity of suffering as perfectly as she does.</p>
<p>Infernals may target themselves or anyone they love with this Charm, though targets of affection need not reciprocate the feelings. Doing so invokes the sanity-shredding power of Adorjan, requiring an opposed roll of (Willpower + Essence) for the attacker and victim. If the target wins, he still loses three Willpower from the force of the mental onslaught. If the warlock wins, she imposes one permanent mutation.</p>
<p>Broken Soul Wisdom may grant any derangement-based negative mutation to the target. Examples include Mood Swings, Delusions and Wyld Addiction (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 288-289), the last of which should be modified to represent a dependence on something more appropriate than the Wyld, like the need to kill someone once a week.</p>
<p>Derangements inflicted with Broken Soul Wisdom can reduce the experience cost of traits besides positive mutations (which this Charm cannot grant). These other options include Essence rating, Virtues, Willpower and Adorjani Charms, though the last option only matters to targets capable of learning the Charms of the Silent Wind. Curing any of these derangements imposes a special Training effect on the patient, forcing her to pay back the free experience gained from her madness.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the gods turned Malfeas inside-out and gave him form, they exposed his inner monstrosity for all to see. Denied Creation, the Demon City must satisfy himself with dominion over his hateful flesh. If he must suffer the humiliation of physical existence, then the parameters of that body will be defined by the raging whim of the onetime Primordial King—and none other.</p>
<p>The Infernal spreads his arms and collapses his anima banner into his flesh, producing a brief, blinding cataclysm of emerald flame. This explosion acts as a one-time environmental damage effect (Damage 3L, Trauma 1) to everything within three yards. When the smoke clears, the Exalt stands transformed, his demonic nature stamped unmistakably into his flesh.</p>
<p>Devil-Tyrant Avatar Shintai has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The warlock simultaneously manifests all (Essence x 10) points of mutations provided by this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite. Devil-Tyrant Avatar Shintai explicitly ignores the normal restrictions on the number of positive mutations a Desecration effect may provide and does not count toward the mutation limit of other such effects. If By Rage Recast supplies mutations that are mutually exclusive to one another, he chooses which to manifest and which to keep inert within him. Mutual exclusivity is the only basis for a mutation not manifesting.</li>
<li>All Shaping effects which would transform the warlock&rsquo;s body become Obvious to his senses. He may reflexively reject any unwanted changes, even while unconscious or otherwise inactive.</li>
<li>The concentrated force of the Infernal&rsquo;s empyrean fury hardens his skin, adding (Essence) to his natural lethal and bashing soak.</li>
<li>The warlock adds (Essence) yards to his base movement and dashing distances.</li>
<li>Finally, the demonic power thrumming through his body increases the warlock&rsquo;s Strength by (Essence) for the purpose of feats of strength and attacking inanimate objects.</li>
</ul>

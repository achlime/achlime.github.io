        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In her endlessness, Cecelyne may stand adjacent to space itself, existing in many points to strike down many foes at once. This Charm is a magical flurry containing a total number of physical attacks equal to (Cult + 2). The attacks bypass rate and suffer no multiple action penalties, while the flurry as a whole imposes a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any attack. The Infernal makes these attacks by collocating, and therefore makes one attack roll and separately compares the attack to a separate defender with each attack in the flurry. Use of First Cecelyne Excellency to enhance this action extends the same benefit to all attacks in the flurry at no additional cost. The first attack in the flurry may hit any target the Exalt can reach. Subsequent attacks require no additional ammunition (if they normally would) but must be aimed at targets within a 10-yard radius of the Infernal or the first target. The cost of this Charm is normally 6m, 1wp, but reduces to 4m, 1wp in a place of desolation.</p>
<p>Infernals with Essence 4+ may purchase Scorpion-Tailed Mirage Technique a second time. Whenever an Infernal with two purchases augments the first attack with First Cecelyne Excellency, he may direct all of those attacks at a single target, copying the attack through encirclement to strike from all sides.</p>

            <p>She Who Lives in Her Name may simulcast her will to the broken-tongued traitors who stole Creation. A character may activate this Charm while in possession of the material intelligence of a manse, though she need not be inside the manse. The warlock opens an Essence channel in all constructs bearing a backdoor created by <a class="complex" href="hollow-mind-possession.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Hollow Mind Possession'"><span class="link-focus">Hollow Mind Possession</span></a> or <a class="complex" href="noumena-seizing-assimilation.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Noumena-Seizing Assimilation'"><span class="link-focus">Noumena-Seizing Assimilation</span></a>, through which she may broadcast her voice clearly enough to be heard for (Essence x 100) yards. The character may choose to broadcast from as many or as few valid targets as she wishes, and may broadcast or omit dialogue as she chooses while this Charm is active. Furthermore, the Infernal has the option of disguising her voice with the same chiming, tinkling suspire of crystals created by <a class="complex" href="disembodied-voice-tintinnabula.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Disembodied Voice Tintinnabula'"><span class="link-focus">Disembodied Voice Tintinnabula</span></a> at no extra cost.</p>
<p>A warlock need not broadcast her voice to make her presence known. While the channel is open, the Infernal may choose to activate <a class="complex" href="mind-spider-curse.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Mind Spider Curse'"><span class="link-focus">Mind Spider Curse</span></a> for 10 motes, one Willpower, unleashing it from all manses she is currently broadcasting from simultaneously. Even though the Charm is Essence 5, this use of Mind Spider Curse is an Essence 7 Blasphemy effect which immediately reveals the location of all manses from which the attack was unleashed. Broadcast Announcement Prana may not be used from other realms of existence.</p>
<p>When using <a class="complex" href="heuristic-logos-shintai.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Heuristic Logos Shintai'"><span class="link-focus">Heuristic Logos Shintai</span></a>, the Infernal may activate Broadcast Announcement Prana for zero motes, allowing her to broadcast her voice through her transformed self. She may also personally inflict Mind Spider Curse on her victims without the use of a manse, using her Shintai as the vector to unleash the mimetic virus of will. Both of the aforementioned Charms as well as <a class="complex" href="space-monster-scream.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Space Monster Scream'"><span class="link-focus">Space Monster Scream</span></a> and <a class="complex" href="world-whale-keening.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'World-Whale Keening'"><span class="link-focus">World-Whale Keening</span></a> have their ranges increased to (Essence x 300) yards while under the effects of <a class="complex" href="heuristic-logos-shintai.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Heuristic Logos Shintai'"><span class="link-focus">Heuristic Logos Shintai</span></a>.</p>

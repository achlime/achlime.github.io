        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal reaches out with Primordial Essence and evokes mass destruction, choosing any epicenter she can perceive up to one mile away. The center must be within a place of desolation and the effect spreads out to affect a maximum diameter of one mile. On a desert, the ripple of force that spreads from the epicenter leaves concentric rings across the dunes like a colossal meditation garden. Particulate matter levitates and begins to blow in a breeze that nothing else feels, though not in sufficient volume to impair visibility. If the Infernal suffers any levels of damage in the ticks until his next action, the Charm&rsquo;s energies recoil and express themselves through him by relocating the epicenter to make him ground zero.</p>
<p>Wherever the epicenter ends up, it explodes after 10 ticks and fills the affected area with a cloud of sand stretching a mile in height that impairs visibility like fog. The cloud takes a full hour to settle to the point where it no longer obscures vision, during which time the area is a place of physical desolation. More importantly, everything in the radius suffers damage from a one-time environmental hazard with piercing Damage of (the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence + Cult)L and Trauma equal to the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence rating. Damage from this charm can come from lacerating sands, crushing sinkholes or any other Storyteller-approved manifestation of &ldquo;desert power&rdquo; that can inflict injury. Incorporeal beings in the radius suffer just as much as materialized beings.</p>
<p>Warlocks who know the Charm <a class="complex" href="scoured-perfection-of-form.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Scoured Perfection of Form'"><span class="link-focus">Scoured Perfection of Form</span></a> may forgo inflicting damage when using World-Grinding Sandstorm Devastation. Doing so allows them to saturate the area with mutagenic Essence that imposes one mutation on all valid recipients of that change caught in the blast who do not pay two Willpower to maintain integrity. The mutation must be appropriate to the themes and imagery of Cecelyne. This is a Desecration effect, so unless the Infernal first uses the Charm to make everyone a creature of darkness, only those already labeled as such will be altered by whatever else the warlock has in mind. Once the effect detonates, its lasting effects can&rsquo;t be reversed with countermagic.</p>
<p>Because the effects of this Charm do not go off immediately, quick enemies may move themselves out of the blast area in time. The 10-second delay is inconsequential to the long ticks of mass combat, though small units should be afforded a chance to get away if fast enough. Complementary units of Magnitude 3+ have no chance to mobilize that quickly, at least not without powerful war magic. If an Infernal has Essence 5+, the entire area continues to inflict its damage at recurring oneminute intervals as the erupted sand whips around in lacerating, unholy vortices. The Infernal may shape any or all of this effect into a likeness of her iconic anima banner at will or leave it an inchoate force.</p>
<p>More importantly, she may also move the area of effect across the land at four times her move speed, telekinetically changing its speed and/or direction with a diceless miscellaneous action or stopping it reflexively. After an hour, the effect dissipates. If the warlock creates a mutagenic sandstorm, she must select the one mutation it imposes at activation; spending Willpower to resist grants the resisting character immunity to that particular storm. Essence 6+ Infernals may have one storm with Indefinite duration, enduring until countered. This provides both superweapon and refuge (since <a class="complex" href="transcendent-desert-creature.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Transcendent Desert Creature'"><span class="link-focus">Transcendent Desert Creature</span></a> grants immunity to its effects), though it also ensures militant heavenly reprisal.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Although Malfeas is seldom subtle, he is a universal overlord and therefore infinitely capable of long-term strategies. This Charm permanently enhances Green Sun Nimbus Flare. Whenever an attack inflicts damage and would trigger secondary burns, the Infernal may suspend the eruption of Essence instead as a Sorcerous effect. The destructive energy remains invisibly embedded in the wound, though any form of Essence sight sees the Old Realm characters for &ldquo;Mandate of Heaven&rdquo; writ in bubbling green fire like an incandescent scar. So long as it remains, this mark also makes its bearer a native of Malfeas unless his supernatural nature is inherently opposed to it (like a non-Infernal Exalt).</p>
<p>Whenever the victim next attacks (physically, socially or otherwise, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion) the Infernal who placed the brand, intentionally or not, the scar bursts with all the deleterious effects that would have taken place originally, and the brand disappears. The victim intuitively understands that she must not oppose the Infernal when he places the brand, though without knowing the consequences.</p>
<p>Unless prematurely dispelled, brands inflicted by this Charm endure until the death of the Infernal or the victim. Applying a new brand to a character the Infernal has already branded removes the first one; however, Infernals may brand any number of separate victims, and victims may be unfortunate enough to be branded by multiple Exalts.</p>

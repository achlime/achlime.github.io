        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Endless Desert makes war, she does so as primal goddess, cataclysmic geography and a limitless horde of demons bound by her law. Even Malfeas is lessser, for his greater might brings him no closer to touching eternity. This Charm reshapes the Infernal in the image of Cecelyne from within a place of physical desolation. As it activates, her body implodes as a tear in space and time, through which the sand of a desert bursts, transforming her anima into a pervasive blight. The violence of the transformation radiates from the Infernal to ravage the area as per the instant duration damaging use of World-Grinding Sandstorm Devastation. Within the cloud of swirling sands, the warlock&rsquo;s Essence expands as an inchoate being of living power. This confers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her body extends as a dematerialized presence through an area a mile across. Her immense size makes attacks by smaller beings undodgeable (without Charms). However, she can&rsquo;t suffer more than one damage level per attack in step 10, unless the attack encompasses at least a tenth of her size. Similarly gargantuan beings ignore these modifiers.</li>
<li>In mass combat, she always enjoys the full +3 Magnitude bonus regardless of the Magnitude of the army she faces; only similarly scaled adversaries (again, such as Juggernaut) ignore this bonus.</li>
<li>Her senses simultaneously observe from all points within her body as though using <a class="complex" href="../solar/all-encompassing-sorcerers-sight.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight'"><span class="link-focus">All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 222), though she does not pay attention to all points equally (making stealth possible).</li>
<li>She may communicate via Performance out to (Essence) miles, speaking in a gravelly yet silken voice.</li>
<li>Characters may deploy social attacks against her from anywhere within her. She may selectively withdraw her attention from areas to perfectly ignore opponents, but this prevents her from observing or acting upon individuals within an ignored area.</li>
<li>She can take actions anywhere within her body with her normal traits, paying 3m per action to physically interact with anything corporeal (social attacks cost nothing). Swirls of phantasmal sand form hazy limbs or weapons with which to manipulate the environment. She doesn&rsquo;t gain more actions, nor the capacity to do anything she couldn&rsquo;t do normally. She just has more room to act.</li>
<li>The warlock is immune to Poison, Crippling, and non-magical Sickness. She can&rsquo;t starve or suffocate.</li>
<li>She may move at her normal movement rate (Dashing and Jumping are impossible), and is immune to Blockade Movement actions.</li>
<li>Her body transforms the land she moves upon into desert as a Shaping effect, returning it to normal as she leaves unless she is Essence 6+. The effects of substituting desert terrain are those associated with <a class="complex" href="holy-land-infliction.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Holy Land Infliction'"><span class="link-focus">Holy Land Infliction</span></a> (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Infernals</strong>, p. 125). She may selectively vary the intensity of the perpetual hazard within herself, applying any one of three settings to any area: blistering heat, sandstorm (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 131), or a supernatural burning sandstorm (Damage 1L/action, Trauma 3).</li>
<li>Submerging her fully in liquid or targeting the center of her being with appropriate countermagic (or Adamant Circle Banishing) terminates the Charm. Though Sorcerous, it can be voluntarily deactivated.</li>
</ul>

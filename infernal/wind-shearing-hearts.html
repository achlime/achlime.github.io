        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Adorjan will fill the world with the silence of letting go. She carries out this thankless crusade with stoic perseverance, but her heroism is its own reward. Nothing is so rewarding to Adorjan as the surge of adrenaline that comes from forcing someone to part ways with their love. This Charm grants the warlock an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it accrues two motes each time she attacks a target that is being protected by way of the Defend Other action, so long as the defender harbors a positive Intimacy toward the Infernal&rsquo;s target. This Intimacy must be more than simple respect or admiration; it must have an intimate emotional context such as friendship or love.</p>
<p>The warlock also gains two offensive motes any time she attacks a Solar or Lunar who is being protected by their mate, regardless of the emotional context of their Intimacies, or lack thereof. The same also applies to Terrestrial Exalted bound by <a class="complex unresolved" title="Unresolved text body link"><span class="link-focus">Sworn Brother’s Oath</span></a> (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power— The Dragon-Blooded</strong>, p. 122).</p>

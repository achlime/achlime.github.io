        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Ebon Dragon is unsatisfied with ruining the present and future. He has to desecrate the past as well. Why else would he invent fate but to spread misery to all time and space? This Charm augments a Manipulation-based social attack targeting one victim (i.e. most likely using Investigation or Presence) in which the Infernal verbally prompts the target to recall positive memories associated with a particular time or subject. &ldquo;Remember your wedding night?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Congratulations on your promotion!&rdquo; are both examples of valid triggers. The memory need not be wholly positive to be targeted, so long as there is some good part to destroy. The Infernal can word the attack so that it ironically validates the positive nature of the memory while actually calling attention to the negative details surrounding it. Regardless of whether the social attack forces an answer or not, the victim vividly relives the targeted experience within her own mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the victim, the Ebon Dragon&rsquo;s power obscures and distorts the fond memory even as she recalls it. If the roll overcomes the target&rsquo;s MDV, the warlock ruins the memory. If the Storyteller determines the target has no positive memories to recall about the chosen topic, the Charm has no effect.</p>
<p>Victims misremember ruined memories in the worst possible light, glossing over or outright forgetting everything good about the experience in question. Everything bad is remembered in exacting and often exaggerated detail. The victim thinks the worst of all other participants in the remembered experience, especially anyone whom she can blame for any harm she suffered (however slight). A mother could misremember her dead son as a lazy good-for-nothing who talked back, forgetting that she also loved him and he loved her. Corrupted memories never introduce outright falsehoods. The mother remembers her son&rsquo;s laziness because he was sometimes lazy and remembers that he talked back because most children do. She does not remember him torturing small animals because that never happened. Thankfully for the Ebon Dragon, everyone is flawed. In that at least, Creation functions as designed.</p>
<p>Ruining memories interferes with Intimacies toward the subject of those memories. If the victim has no such Intimacy, then a negative Intimacy instantly forms toward that subject. Any existing positive Intimacy warps into a negative Intimacy. In either case, the victim&rsquo;s player chooses the Intimacy&rsquo;s new emotional context, subject to Storyteller approval. For instance, the aforementioned mother may feel resentment toward her son or hatred or contempt.</p>
<p>Corrupted memories are an unnatural Illusion effect. The victim can repair her damaged mind by paying one Willpower if she had no Intimacy toward the subject of the memory when the Infernal used Golden Years Tarnished Black or two Willpower if the Charm corrupted a positive Intimacy. This may seem counterintuitive given that a positive Intimacy helps defend against the Charm, but if the accursed magic takes root in spite of this bonus, the feelings turn cancerous and become a liability. The victim can pay this Willpower to heal the memory in the moment the Charm takes root (which also prevents the Intimacy from forming or being corrupted), but if she does not do so, she must wait until externally prompted or provide a compelling Storyteller-approved reason to question the memory.</p>
<p>Intimacies formed or corrupted by this Charm do not count against the usual limit a mind can sustain, at least so long as the associated memories remain corrupted. After all, the Ebon Dragon wouldn&rsquo;t want his enemies getting over their misery just because life went on. Once the memory heals, the Intimacy falls away as normal if neglected. Even without such healing, it is still possible to remove the Intimacy through normal means other than neglect.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 3+ allows it to enhance Performance-based spoken attacks as an alternative to the basic single-target use. In doing so, the Infernal picks a single topic and all listeners react to the Charm as though separately targeted by the address. The corruptive mass oratory has no effect on listeners lacking appropriate memories to subvert.</p>

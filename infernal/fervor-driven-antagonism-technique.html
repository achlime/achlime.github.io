        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The worst cruelty the Exalted inflicted on the Primordials was forcing the humiliated titans to pay attention to their conquerors and care about them in the ways that they never thought about vermin. Turnabout is fair play. This Charm is an unnatural and unblockable social attack directed at a single target using a dice pool of (Manipulation + Presence + Essence). No actual communication takes place, as the magic reaches directly into the target&rsquo;s soul to poison her heart without regard for language barriers. Conventional senses cannot detect this assault, though victims with the power to perceive Charms (such as through Essence sight) understand exactly what the warlock is attempting and the attack is not unblockable for them. Even victims who remain unaware of the curse levied against their souls can apply their Dodge MDV as a passive instinct, but do not know they have done so.</p>
<p>If the attack succeeds, the target can pay three Willpower to reject the unholy influence. Doing so does not grant awareness of the magic she avoided, though she feels inexplicably tired. Fortunately, paying this Willpower also immunizes her against all applications of this Charm for the rest of the scene. Victims who fail to pay Willpower against a successful attack suffer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The victim must avoid the warlock for a full month to break the Charm&rsquo;s magic (defined in subsequent bullets). Any scene of social interaction resets this countdown, whether hostile or cordial.</li>
<li>If the victim harbors an existing Intimacy toward the warlock when the Charm takes hold, the Infernal learns that fact and understands the nature of those feelings. Moreover, that Intimacy becomes enchanted as an Emotion effect. If eroded or removed, the Intimacy returns at full strength each day at sunset until the magic ends. Effects that change the emotional context of the Intimacy are permissible and don&rsquo;t get reversed; the redefined Intimacy reasserts itself normally with its new context.</li>
<li>If the victim has no Intimacy toward the Infernal at the time of activation, the Infernal realizes this and chooses an emotional context. The victim then gains an Intimacy toward him with the chosen context. The enchanted Intimacy continually reasserts itself as explained in the previous bullet.</li>
<li>The victim feels drawn to seek out the Infernal, finding him to be irresistibly fascinating. This Servitude effect doesn&rsquo;t actually compel her in any way. Instead, the forced attention gnaws at her dreams. For every five days that pass without spending a scene socially interacting with the warlock, the victim suffers a cumulative -1 internal penalty on Conviction rolls to regain Willpower from rest. This penalty can reduce the pool to zero dice, forfeiting any gain. A scene of interaction with the warlock resets the penalty to zero (but resets the month countdown).</li>
</ul>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm requires Essence 4+, but permits a Performance-based attack as an alternative to the standard Presence-based method described above. Compare the attack roll to the MDV of all listeners, each of whom resist separately as though individually targeted. All new Intimacies formed this way must have the same emotional context. The Storyteller may assume that no one resists unless they are naturally wary and untrusting or harbor personal animosity toward the warlock. Players choose whether to resist or not as normal.</p>

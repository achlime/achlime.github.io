        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Though it is true that, at one time, a being known as the Empyreal Chaos was forced to admit defeat, none can say the same of the Yozi called Malfeas. It seems unthinkable that one should ever vanquish the Demon City… yet the same was said of King of All Kings in the Time of Glory. Should the Infernal fall in battle with any offensive motes in his Overdrive pool, he may pay one mote, one Willpower as his final health level is checked off in step 10 and he becomes incapacitated. He falls, almost to a knee, or slouches to one side as if to topple, but stops himself. Suddenly his anima roars to the 16+ level of display as a local earthquake rips through the area for five miles. This tremor comes from within the warlock and sends emerald and crimson-tinged cracks racing across his skin to congregate around his blazing caste mark, while his eyes shine with all the furies there ever were. The legend of the Empyreal Chaos wreathes his chest, biceps and thighs and bounds his forehead like a crown. For the next action, the warlock is perfectly immune to all attacks and harm, but may not act, save to activate any one shintai he knows. If no shintai is activated, the Infernal effectively remains Inactive for that one action. When this action ends, the blaze dies down, and the Infernal&rsquo;s final horrific onslaught can begin.</p>
<p>The Infernal&rsquo;s Overdrive pool immediately gains 10 motes. From that point forward, the Infernal will remain active, attacking, and unable to retreat until his Overdrive pool reaches zero. He may regain Overdrive motes during this time, but his pool empties at a rate of three offensive motes per action. During this time, the Infernal may not benefit from any magic which heals damage. Attacks which strike him during this time, which do not accrue more than (Infernal&rsquo;s Essence x 3) dice of post-soak damage fail to even register—he suffers no damage from them. Only attacks which cripple or dismember the outraged Slayer have a prayer of slowing him down.</p>
<p>Finally, offensive Charms fueled by his Overdrive are reduced in cost by one mote, to a minimum of zero motes. The Infernal may not apply more than one zero mote Charm to any given attack, but he may stack any reduced-cost offensive Charms he can afford so long as they cost at least one mote.</p>
<p>When the frenzy ends, the Infernal rolls (Stamina + Essence) against difficulty 5. Failure leaves the Infernal incapacitated; success restores the Infernal&rsquo;s incapacitated health level, although he may not activate Driven Beyond Death again within the scene. As a point of clarification, this Charm may only be triggered when the Infernal is truly incapacitated—for instance, marking off the Infernal&rsquo;s final health box with lethal damage would not permit him to trigger Driven Beyond Death if he had By Agony Empowered active.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In all of Malfeas, among all races of demons spawned of every Yozi, one prayer unites the best and worst of Hell in common terror: &ldquo;May the peace of Adorjan not fall upon me.&rdquo; Their desperate pleas are prayers to her, empowering her to bestow her unique instructive kindness upon them. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal&rsquo;s body achieves ascetic transcendence as it dissolves like eroded stone. In the blink of an eye, the Exalt reappears as a crimson-hued gale swirling with mirage distortions, before coalescing into a perfect rendition of herself, sculpted from violent, blood-hued winds. This form confers the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A silent wind swirls around the Infernal, a killing cyclone with only her in its eye. This wind is identical to the destructive aura of Pellegrina&rsquo;s Fury, but with a range of (Essence x 50) yards. All benefits of Wind-Daughter&rsquo;s Wrath that the warlock has access to also apply to this effect. Mass units are especially vulnerable to this wind, doubling the damage they take each tick and the mote cost their commander must pay to protect them.</li>
<li>As a creature of living, semi-solid wind, she is immune to mundane attacks, and reduces magical attacks against her to minimum damage. Attacks that have no physical component or that have an area of effect bypass this protection. Any equipment she carries takes on the same wind-like nature, allowing her to use it normally.</li>
<li>She cannot be affected by clinches or Blockade Movement actions unless they use magic that could reasonably constrain the wind itself, nor can she take such actions herself. Any Poison, Sickness, or Crippling that could not reasonably affect a being whose body is living wind cannot affect her.</li>
<li>She adds her (Essence + sum of all Virtues) to her dashing speed. She must move at her maximum dash speed on each tick or this Charm ends.</li>
</ul>

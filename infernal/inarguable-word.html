        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. In addition to stopping physical attacks, the Charm also prevents demons from making social attacks specifically targeted at the Infernal unless compelled by sorcerous binding. Attacks that affect all listeners (like most Performance attacks) may be used, as may targeted social attacks to convince the Infernal of something that is already in line with her Motivation, Urge or Intimacies. If the MDV reduction for such traits applies, the attack is valid. Likewise, if the attack is a form of natural influence and the demon uses a stunt to reference how the attack is in line with the warlock&rsquo;s prior actions, it bypasses this Charm. If Unquestionable Yozi Authority can affect gods, they are likewise socially inhibited.</p>

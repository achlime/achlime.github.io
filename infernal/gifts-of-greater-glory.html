        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Gifts of strength or beauty or wealth may entice mortals, but such enticements do little to snare the Exalted. This Charm extends the scope of <a class="complex" href="verdant-emptiness-endowment.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Verdant Emptiness Endowment'"><span class="link-focus">Verdant Emptiness Endowment</span></a>, allowing the warlock to bestow a Charm in lieu of increasing a mundane trait in exchange for a later favor. The bestowed Charm need not be one that the Infernal knows or is even capable of learning, but it must be one that the target is naturally capable of learning and already meets all required trait minimums and prerequisites for. The gift must also fulfill an expressed desire as normal. There is nothing remotely subtle about learning a Charm this way. Old Realm characters conveying the bestowed Charm&rsquo;s nature appear in glowing sand and swirl around the beneficiary. If Exalted, her anima flares iconic.</p>
<p>There are limits to Gifts of Greater Glory. Charms permitting access to sorcery can only be bestowed on those whom the Storyteller determines has completed the appropriate five trials, while Charms allowing access to necromancy can&rsquo;t be given. Martial Arts Charms require the warlock to know them personally before giving them, an inherent limitation of the Perfected Lotus. Because the gift bypasses training time, a gift of a known Martial Arts Enlightenment Charm can instantly open a Terrestrial&rsquo;s potential to learn Celestial styles. If Gifts of Greater Glory targets oneself, the Infernal owes himself nothing, but gains a number of points of Limit equal to the Charm&rsquo;s minimum Essence. Warlocks with Essence 5+ gain the power to give a sorcery spell to a sorcerer initiated into that spell&rsquo;s circle as per giving a Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>While the Ebon Dragon stands to gain more from ruining beautiful memories than further sullying painful recollections, he believes he can always find a way to worsen the world. After all, he always has so far. Purchase of this Charm broadens the utility of its prerequisite in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Charm can target memories that don&rsquo;t have a meaningful positive component to them. There&rsquo;s not much silver lining to &ldquo;That day you watched your little girl die in front of your eyes.&rdquo; When a bad memory is made worse this way, every pain associated with that memory becomes accentuated and exaggerated. A soldier remembers the fateful day his legion fell in battle against the Anathema as if it happened only yesterday. He remembers the sound of his friends&rsquo; screams, the awful crunch of their bones and the shocked look as the newest recruit tried vainly to stuff his entrails back into his body after the monster eviscerated him with a backhanded slap. He remembers the stink of blood and offal and rancid sweat. Absence of a negative Intimacy creates one in the victim with a Stoyteller-approved emotional context picked by the victim&rsquo;s player.</li>
<li>At the Infernal&rsquo;s discretion, part of the imposed memory distortion can involve reassignment of blame to a target of the warlock&rsquo;s choosing. The victim&rsquo;s player can choose any Storyteller-approved chain of logic to justify this new opinion, however twisted and tangled. If the Storyteller cannot construct such a narrative because there is simply no way the new scapegoat could be responsible, the attack automatically fails. Still, this offers immense latitude. A child can construct a dozen reasons why it is her fault that her father abandoned her and her mother. If only she had been better behaved or told her daddy how much she loved him, he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone away.</li>
<li>If the Infernal knows the Charm <a class="complex" href="weak-minds-believe-anything.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Weak Minds Believe Anything'"><span class="link-focus">Weak Minds Believe Anything</span></a>, he receives additional benefit when making a discount-cost victim believe she is the ultimate cause of her own suffering as explained previously. Such victims also lose (6 - the Infernal&rsquo;s Compassion) additional Willpower as the memory twists. If this depletes all of an extra&rsquo;s remaining Willpower, that victim&rsquo;s will breaks and she attempts to kills herself from shame and self-loathing at every opportunity for one day. If she survives due to the intervention of others, the urge passes. Despair wrought by this unnatural Compulsion is explicitly capable of overriding a target&rsquo;s survival instinct, thereby issuing the unstated and normally unacceptable order to commit suicide. The souls of victims who kill themselves as a result of Everything Gets Worse fall straight into Oblivion barring other magic that forces them to linger as a ghost or pass into Lethe. Much to the Ebon Dragon&rsquo;s frustration, annihilation trumps his Charms to banish souls into the darkness beyond existence. He has yet to find a way to inflict absolute despair for eternity, though not for lack of trying.</li>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Kimbery alone devours Kimbery, for none else is worthy. This Charm may be activated in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By paying five motes in step 2, the Infernal can reject any unwanted Shaping effect. This causes her to gain a mutation of her player&rsquo;s choice as a permanent Desecration (emulating the biology of aquatic life). With Essence 4+, she can also block Crippling effects by gaining a mutation, paying only three motes if the mutation connects to the averted injury (like a severed hand staying attached via sinewy tentacle). This use is an innate power rather than Charm activation.</li>
<li>By paying three Willpower while submerged in a sea, the Infernal can dissolve any mutation she possesses, provided it is not a prerequisite for other traits she possesses. Until Essence 4+, she can only dissolve mutations she gave herself.</li>
<li>With Essence 3+, the warlock can pay three Willpower to enhance a physical attack that hit a living target with mutations in step 10. The attack inflicts an extra level of lethal damage as it painfully dissolves a mutation of the Infernal&rsquo;s choice.</li>
</ul>

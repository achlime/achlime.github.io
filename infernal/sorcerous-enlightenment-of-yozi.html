        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By the power of the Primordials, Creation came into existence and elements, deities and even life upon it. Sorcery is this power, filtered down through fractured glimpses of understanding that cannot begin to describe the intricate elegance of the universe. To be a sorcerer is to be mad with jagged shards of cosmic awareness and with will and might enough to impose that madness on the world.</p>
<p>This cluster of Charms each grant the shallowest fragments of supernal wisdom, enough to learn and cast spells of the Emerald Circle. Subsequent purchases of the same version unlock higher circles. Spells require the usual costs and spell-shaping actions when cast this way. Each variation of this Charm belongs to one of the Yozis and grants a particular benefit that may be invoked whenever that Charm is used to cast a spell. In addition to these powers, each variant imposes the themes and imagery of the appropriate Yozi upon every spell cast using that initiation. For example, tarnished brass blades with barbed stingers replace obsidian butterflies for the Malfean spell that comes out Death of Brass Wasps. This substitution of imagery never materially alters the effects of a spell except in the slightest of ways and is not optional. The player may select the modified imagery with Storyteller approval.</p>
<p>The integration of Yozi themes can be subtle or overt and may even vary with each casting of the same spell, but Yozi power resists efforts to hide its glory. Even if the sorcerer attempts to minimize the warping effects on his sorcery by integrating extremely minor special effects, observers with Occult 1+ still recognize the taint with a reflexive (Wits + Occult) roll at difficulty 5. The only way to completely hide a Yozi&rsquo;s influence is to cast a spell that already completely resonates with the Yozi&rsquo;s thematic imagery, such as when Malfeas hurls Total Annihilation or the Ebon Dragon disgorges Summoning the Heart of Darkness.</p>
<p>Sorcerers may learn as many different initiations as they meet the prerequisites for. They can&rsquo;t cast a spell using multiple initiations at once, however.</p>
<p>This Charm may be purchased a second time by Infernals with Essence 4+, deepening the patterns of creative psychosis through which miracles occur. Such characters may learn and cast Sapphire Circle spells with the benefits and drawbacks of their initiation, though it is harder to hide the warping touch of the Yozis (difficulty 3 to recognize as above). A third and final purchase of this Charm at Essence 5+ unlocks the core truths of forces and principles by which worlds were fashioned and allows learning and casting of Adamant Circle spells within the bounds of initiation. Such spells proclaim the Yozi whose glory they express with all the subtlety of Erembour&rsquo;s horn (difficulty 1 to recognize).</p>
<p>Spells with any Holy effects represent innovations of Creation&rsquo;s Exalted never dreamed by the Primordials and whose nature is antithetical to Yozi Essence. Such magic can&rsquo;t be learned. Primordial sorcery does not bind demons through the oaths of the vanquished Yozis, but rather in fulfillment of Cecelyne&rsquo;s cruel law. <strong>Infernal sorcerers cannot learn conventional demon summoning spells</strong>, but they may learn variations that non-Yozi-bound sorcerers cannot hope to understand (see below). The spell Summon Elemental is also forbidden by incompatible Essence. Finally, each Yozi has taboos against its nature that prohibit casting or learning of certain spells with that initiation. Spells not included in the Exalted corebook that are mentioned below may be found in <strong>The Book of Sorcery, Vol. II—The White Treatise</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Malfeas:</strong> Spells that inflict damage as their primary effect such as Death of Obsidian Butterflies or Total Annihilation resonate with the hate of the Demon City, increasing their base damage by half again before attack successes factor in. For example, Death of Brass Wasps inflicts 12L rather than 8L. Spells that inflict damage over time may be enhanced this way, but only the first instance of damage inflicted against a particular victim gets the boost. Further damage to the same target does not increase, though those the spell has yet to damage are fair game. The Sorcerous Enlightenment of Malfeas cannot cast spells that bring peace or physical calm (however confused and mad). Examples include Mists of Eventide, Paralyzing Contradiction, The Battle&rsquo;s End, Wheel of the Turning Heavens and Winds of Confusion. The only calm that may result from his spells is the stillness that descends upon battlefields in the wake of the devastation he unleashes.</p>
<p><strong>Cecelyne:</strong> The laws of the Endless Desert guide the interactions of her sorcery and entities called upon to attend her will. Use of her initiation reduces the cost of all spells that naturally summon, bind or banish other beings by 10 motes and one Willpower (minimum five motes, one Willpower). Cecelyne is equally at home dominating the Minions of the Eyeless Face as demons. Her taboo bars any spell from creating edible food or potable water and spells that create or manipulate the element of wood as a primary effect. Spells that only produce forbidden effects as a side effect rather than their primary purpose may be warped in such a way as to remove this ancillary benefit but cannot be cast as they are. For example, the City-Swallowing Sandstorm Attack that replaces the monsoon of a traditional Torrential Cascade leaves choking dunes instead of drinkable water, but Cecelyne has no means of adapting a spell like Food from the Aerial Table or Sprouting Shackles of Doom to her aesthetic of desolation.</p>
<p><strong>She Who Lives In Her Name:</strong> The Principle of Hierarchy abhors free will with every mote of her being. Spells that seek to override another&rsquo;s free will, beliefs or memories cost 10 motes and one Willpower less than normal (minimum five motes, one Willpower). Examples of valid spells include Commanding the Beasts, Corrupted Words, Curse of Slavish Humility, Droning Suggestion, Peacock Shadow Eyes, Silent Words of Dreams and Nightmares, Song of the Waves, Sorcerer&rsquo;s Irresistible Puppetry, Theft of Memory, Insidious Tendrils of Hate, Threefold Binding of the Heart and Mirage of Protective Shelter. Spells that summon and bind entities fall under the touch of Cecelyne, not She Who Lives In Her Name. The Principle of Hierarchy does not believe in violence unless it is absolute; accordingly, Emerald and Sapphire spells whose primary purpose is inflicting damage cost an additional one Willpower.</p>
<p><strong>Adorjan:</strong> The Silent Wind goes where she wills and lets none gainsay her. Her initiation holds special sway over spells that can accelerate a journey, whether by actual quickening, teleportation or some other means. Spells that summon or create beings for the purpose of conveyance do not count, for Adorjan sails on nothing but herself and refuses to admit the utility of Cecelyne&rsquo;s domain. Such spells come effortlessly to the wandering windstorm and cost no Willpower to cast. Adorjan kills as she passes among her enemies, not from afar. Spells that attack or impose harm to other characters past close-combat range cost an additional Willpower.</p>
<p><strong>Ebon Dragon:</strong> Shadows of all sorts belong to the Shadow of All Things. Spells that naturally create or manipulate shadows or darkness or otherwise dampen light or incorporate reflections as a primary effect cost 10 motes and one Willpower less (minimum five motes, one Willpower). The same discount applies to spells that specifically open or shatter physical barriers such as doors or walls. Spells that incorporate these elements solely because of using this initiation do not count. Examples of valid spells include Open the Spirit Door, Shadow Summons, Shadowy Simulacrums of Smoke, The Spy Who Walks In Darkness, The Violent Opening of Closed Portals, Shadow Theft, Shadows of the Ancient Past, Summon the Heavenly Portal, Summoning the Heart of Darkness, The Crumbling Walls, Curse of Unyielding Mist, Evocation From the Mirror and Technique Mirror. The Ebon Dragon is as incapable of casting spells that generate meaningful illumination as Cecelyne is incapable of creating food and drink. This limitation may be bypassed to the same extent through spell warping.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The death cry of Lilike, fetich soul of the River of Torments, armed her murderer with a horrid bane against the newly incarnated Adorjan. Accordingly, this Charm may be learned by Solars, Lunars and Sidereals for 16 experience points as though the Chosen were a member of the Eclipse Caste. No teacher is necessary if the character has ever heard the Charm used. Gods and demons who have heard the Charm can teach it, though they can&rsquo;t actually learn it themselves.</p>
<p>The Demon-Wracking Shout is a cry that exceeds all others, both in volume and in the scope of its anguish. As this Charm activates, a piece of the Exalt&rsquo;s soul tears off and pours from his mouth as a screaming wind that courses over the battlefield like Adorjan herself. Demons within a radius of one mile suffer levels of unsoakable aggravated damage equal to the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence rating. Those killed join the scream, bodies remaining upright and shrieking as bloody streamers of Essence pour from their dead mouths for a heartbeat before the gale disintegrates them. Any First Circle demon who survives suffers an irresistible Compulsion to flee the area and not return for five days. Until then, they treat efforts to make them return as unacceptable orders. Second and Third Circle survivors also feel this Compulsion but may resist by spending five Willpower. Demons descended from Adorjan can&rsquo;t resist regardless of their circle. All beings within the radius suffer deafness as a Crippling effect, though hearing returns to Essence users at the end of the scene. Souls of non-Yozi Primordials caught in the radius suffer as demons do, though souls transformed into non-spirit states of existence like demesnes or artifacts do not.</p>
<p>Adorjan herself (along with any other who has learned <a class="complex" href="hateful-wretched-noise.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Hateful Wretched Noise'"><span class="link-focus">Hateful Wretched Noise</span></a>) suffers no damage from the Charm, but its Compulsion exorcises her as readily as her progeny. She also suffers an Emotion effect that forces her to instantly develop an Intimacy of love toward the character who dared echo her slain fetich, replacing any existing Intimacy to the character based on another emotional context. Lilike&rsquo;s murderer Marus came to regret the love of Adorjan and vainly sought to earn her hatred until his terrible death. Those who wield this Charm against her must never forget what her love means.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When Infernals really stop to consider their power, it becomes obvious that no one else&rsquo;s perspective or opinion actually matters. Sadly, the world is mad without its king and insistently dares otherwise. The nagging contradiction weighs on an Infernal&rsquo;s mind, gradually twisting her sanity inside out until it can once more recall the irrelevance of others. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm would spend one or more Willpower points to resist any form of mental influence, she may reflexively gain one point of Limit instead. She gains an extra Limit as usual if this is the first time she resisted unnatural mental influence in a scene. This Charm does not function during Limit Break. Only in the grip of true madness can Malfeas consider the terrible possibility that the universe might contain more perspectives than his own.</p>

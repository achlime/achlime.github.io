        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When enraged, Kimbery lashes enemies with her infinite arms. Upon activation, the character chooses at least one cupful of any inanimate liquid she can perceive within (Essence x 100) yards. The usual gore of a battlefield is generally more than sufficient. The liquid darkens and hisses as it gains a semblance of life, swelling and coagulating to form (Essence rating) gelatinous, green-black tentacles up to (Essence x 3) yards long. These emerge from the spot (or spots) where they were created. The warlock can reflexively retract these tentacles back through their individual anchor points and extrude them from other liquids within range, meaning nowhere within range is safe.</p>
<p>Mentally wielded as separate close combat weapons with (Wits + Occult), the tentacles ignore cover penalties from anything less than total cover and inflict bashing by default. The Infernal can make their attacks lethal by willing them to grow suckers, barbs, mouths or acid tear-weeping eyes. She must flurry normally to wield multiple tentacles simultaneously. Attacks against the lashing tentacles are futile; their writhing undulations dodge even undodgeable attacks. They don&rsquo;t dodge or parry while clinching a victim; if struck during this time, they have 10L soak and are immune to bashing damage, requiring ten levels of damage to destroy. If all tentacles are destroyed, the Charm deactivates. Reactivating Ichor Flux Tendrils while active regenerates all destroyed tendrils. When the Charm ends for any reason, remaining tentacles evaporate into tarry fumes.</p>
<p>An Essence 3+ repurchase allows the tentacles to make clinches without additional effort on their creator&rsquo;s part, wielding themselves with accuracy and bashing damage 10. The warlock reflexively selects a target and decides whether to hold or crush. After that, the tentacle does the rest, seeking to repeat the action on that target until given new directions or personally wielded by the Infernal. The Infernal can only take direct control or indicate new targets on her action tick. She can always command an autonomous tentacle to reflexively release a victim and resume its usual mad writhing. Only two autonomous tentacles can clinch the same target.</p>

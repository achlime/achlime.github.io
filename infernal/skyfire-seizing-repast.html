            <p>The Green Sun beats hot on the continental districts and world-impaling skyscraper manses of the Demon City, yet it does not scorch the mirrored brass and garish verdigris entwining every wall and roof. Infernals with this Charm may similarly absorb and dissipate the damage inflicted by purely energy-based attacks. Examples include fire and other concentrated elemental Essence, Essence cannon fire or an Abyssal&rsquo;s <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/crypt-bolt-attack.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Crypt Bolt Attack'"><span class="link-focus">Crypt Bolt Attack</span></a> but not effects such as Death of Obsidian Butterflies. Skyfire-Seizing Repast can&rsquo;t defend against Holy attacks. Use of this Charm against a valid damage source reduces the post-soak damage by the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence. If this reduces the damage pool to zero dice, the attack is completely absorbed into the Infernal&rsquo;s anima and flares the banner to one level of display brighter than it was before, leaving her untouched. Otherwise, the remaining damage penetrates the anima flare normally. The Infernal also regains motes equal to the lesser of (her Essence x 2) or the (original post-soak damage of the attack x 2).</p>
<p>Any motes granted by this Charm must be added to the Infernal&rsquo;s Overdrive pool as offensive motes. If he does not have an Overdrive pool, they are lost. Skyfire-Seizing Repast only provides motes if the Infernal is attacked against his will; he cannot gain Essence by deliberately harming himself or allowing an ally to do so. Weapons of solid Essence such as a Glorious Solar Saber or a beamklave are not affected by the defense of this Charm.</p>

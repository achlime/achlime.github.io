        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Adorjan does not kill because she enjoys the pain of others, but because it is natural for her to do so. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm takes a single action that kills one or more natural animals no smaller than herself or thinking beings of any size, she reflexively respires one mote per victim (up to five motes per action). The murderous act also physically nourishes her for one day. The character never becomes too full regardless of how many meals of violence she savors. She only receives these rewards after she turns her back on the remains of her victims or the site of their deaths and moves away. Attaining higher Essence extends the duration of satiation provided by each feast of violence: one week (Essence 4) or one year (Essence 5+).</p>
<p>If the Infernal has Compassion 3+, she no longer needs to fail a roll or spend Willpower to harm mortals in ways that violate Compassion. Such beings are beneath her, and their pain does not trouble her. Conversely, the Infernal can&rsquo;t channel Compassion to aid mortals. The sufferings of fellow Essence users compel her heart normally and may prompt her to channel Compassion to help them.</p>
<p>This Charm grants an Overdrive pool of ten motes; all motes granted by it are offensive. Killing extras does not provide offensive motes, although it still grants the other benefits of this Charm.</p>

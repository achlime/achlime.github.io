        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Green Sun Prince may liberate others from their ill-considered promises, though doing so is not without price. Akuma cannot learn this Charm, for its nature is metaphysically antithetical to the vows that enslave them. Oath-Shattering Strike may only be activated after flaring the runes of One Hand Fury through an activation of Infernal Monster Style. The Exalt must also know the terms of the magical oath he intends to shatter, and that oath must have been sanctified by a being with an Essence no greater than the Infernal&rsquo;s own unmodified permanent rating.</p>
<p>The Infernal strikes the target who swore the oath with an unarmed blow. Runes of power explode around the target, depicting the terms and authority of the oath in the moments before they dissolve into emerald fire and sand. The target is freed from the oath, but the burden for breaking it falls upon the Infernal in full as if he had sworn and deliberately broken the vow. Whether this Charm is powerful enough to fulfill its ultimate purpose remains to be seen, as no Green Sun Princes with Essence 10 exist to test it against the promises the Unconquered Sun exacted from his defeated masters.</p>

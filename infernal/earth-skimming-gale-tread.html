        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Adorjan often flies low to the ground, the better to ravage her prey. Bloody-hued winds swirl around the Infernal in an eerily silent vortex, bearing him aloft to a maximum height of (Athletics rating) yards off the ground. The vortex obviates Stealth like an eight to ten mote anima banner. The Exalt can hover, fly and otherwise move without regard for gravity so long as he observes this limited flight ceiling, flitting along at his normal ground speed. The altitude limit merely requires that he remain close to a solid or liquid surface, so the Charm can be used to fly up the side of a wall or glide over a river. Losing consciousness terminates the Charm.</p>
<p>If the character ever finds himself with more distance separating him from an acceptable surface, he falls normally until he is back within the normal limit of the ground, at which point he slows to a quick stop without suffering harm.</p>
<p>A second purchase requires Essence 4+ but removes the flight ceiling entirely. A third purchase at Essence 5+ extends the Charm&rsquo;s duration to Indefinite and reduces the cost to (10 – Essence rating) motes.</p>

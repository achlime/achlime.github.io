        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm upgrades its prerequisite with a new optional effect powered by chaining a live First Circle Demon at the center of its radius. The pit devours this offering and thereafter spawns a new member of that demon race that crawls out slime-caked and howling with instinctual terror of Adorjan each midnight. Creating a new species of demon costs 1xp in lieu of a sacrifice, but any of the demons who rise from that pit may serve as a &ldquo;seed&rdquo; for other spawning pits. The warlock&rsquo;s player designs any new race (subject to Storyteller approval). Demons birthed by a pit come into life fully mature as average members of their species, unbound and materialized. They also begin life devoid of motes and Willpower points and with no special loyalty to their creator. It is wise to keep guards on hand to capture these monsters and cage them in their weakened state before they run rampant. This Charm can only sustain a maximum of (Essence x 2) demon-creating pits at one time. Creating a new one past this limit terminates the rise of demons from a pit of the warlock&rsquo;s choice, though that site continues to provide locusts.</p>
<p>With Essence 6+ demons emerge with up to 12 points of positive mutations upgrading them above baseline as a Desecration effect; the exact mutation package is set when the pit is created and can&rsquo;t be altered. From flying blood apes to gargantuan agata troop transports, the possibilities provided by this mutation are only as limited as the Infernal&rsquo;s twisted imagination. With Essence 7+, the pit can spawn a demon every hour instead every night, but this option turns the effect into a Blasphemy.</p>

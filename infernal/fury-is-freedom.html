        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The rage of the Infernal Monster is not just a shield against mental trickery and domination. Anger frees the mind. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite. Whenever the Infernal activates Retribution Will Follow, he can pay one aggravated health level and gain two Limit in addition to committing the usual mote. Doing so terminates all unnatural mental influence effects currently affecting his mind unless these effects meet one of the following criteria: the influence was self-imposed, the influence was caused by a being with a higher Essence rating than the Infernal&rsquo;s Martial Arts at the time it was imposed or the influence functions by making the Infernal angry or taking advantage of his fury to make him perform specific anger-driven behavior. Use of Retribution Will Follow this way can reduce Limit by slaughtering or maiming, reducing the net increase to one point rather than two. When the killing rage passes, shattered mental influence effects do not return.</p>
<p>A secondary benefit of Fury is Freedom is that no mental influence can prevent the Exalt from activating Retribution Will Follow. It does not matter whether Fury Is Freedom can break the influence in question; nothing can prevent the Infernal from frenzying when he encounters the appropriate stimuli enabling activation of Retribution Will Follow.</p>

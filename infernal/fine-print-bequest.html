        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Endless Desert exacts a terrible price for her generosity. That doesn&rsquo;t mean her generosity needs not also have strings attached. Upon learning this Charm, the Infernal gains the power to add a clause to each gift she bestows with Verdant Emptiness Endowment. To do this, she must offer to fulfill the target&rsquo;s expressed desire and inform the target of the clause, which may be an action the target must never do or which he must do in response to specific stimuli. The clause must be something the target is actually capable of doing, though the difficulty is irrelevant. If all these conditions are met and the target accepts the blessing, the clause takes effect. Should the target ever break the terms of the clause, the blessing fades away over the same time it took to appear (returning appropriate experience points if applicable).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Sulumor offers to make a warrior deadlier with his sword, granting the Melee specialty Swords +1. She warns that the gift is contingent on him never raising a hand against her. This gift takes a scene to appear, so if he ever physically attacks her, the specialty disappears at the end of the scene.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The individual mortals who pray to an Infernal are as meaningless as individual grains of sand. Still, it is by the accretion of many grains that deserts come to be. This Charm allows the Exalt to hear individual prayers spoken from places of desolation as though she were a spirit. Actually listening to all prayers imposes a -3 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions; if the Infernal tunes them out, the Storyteller only relays the most widely repeated or urgently spoken prayers.</p>
<p>Supplicants who pray from within a blight the Infernal has created with the Charm <a class="complex" href="holy-land-infliction.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Holy Land Infliction'"><span class="link-focus">Holy Land Infliction</span></a> (see pp. 125-126) may be answered by causing a random object in the supplicant&rsquo;s presence to glow and change into the Infernal&rsquo;s incarnate image as an Obvious Shaping effect for three motes. The enchanted object delivers whatever spoken response the Infernal sends through it (which may encompass one Social attack or informative response) and then returns to normal.</p>

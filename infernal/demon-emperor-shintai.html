        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As this Charm activates, the Infernal&rsquo;s being evolves into pure Essence and expands at infinite speed to encompass the universe. For a moment, his feet tread the shinma and the wholeness of fate tangles about his limbs like tattered cobwebs. Time sits at his right hand and resurrection upon his left. He has become the Infinite Radiant Is, the supernal transcendence of all divinity, the Holy Tyrant, the King of the Primordials. It cannot last. The infinite gravitation of humiliation crushes him, layer upon layer, until he finds himself imprisoned within a body of shining brass and volcanic stone.</p>
<p>The Demon Emperor form is slightly larger than the character&rsquo;s natural body, and is visually recognizable as the warlock to those few who can gaze upon its awful radiance and survive. It surges and bucks from within, constantly fracturing to release shafts of darting molten radiance, only to quickly re-seal itself. Entire sections sometimes burst, the momentary rupture exposing smoking brass bones and a deadly emerald star where the Infernal&rsquo;s heart should be in the moments before the shell knits itself closed again. The character&rsquo;s anima flares to its full iconic state, expanding beyond all reason to encompass an area (Essence x 50) yards in radius. To watchers from afar, it may appear that some vast phantasmal behemoth moves across the land. This form confers the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The warlock gains benefits identical to the second purchase of Viridian Legend Exoskeleton (this cancels and will not stack with already existing activations of that Charm), as well as an additional +10L/10B soak on top of that amount.</li>
<li>The interior of the Infernal&rsquo;s anima banner becomes toxic with the terrible might of his radiance, searing all within with terrible burns and deadly bleeding sores. The afflicted drown in blood as their lungs disintegrate and flesh putrefies. This (Damage [Essence / 2]B /action, Trauma 5) environmental hazard only harms animate beings. Victims may negate this damage with a Miscellaneous Speed 5, DV -2 action, prostrating themselves before the Infernal and pressing their foreheads to the ground in utter supplication (rising from prone immediately voids the protection such groveling affords). Doing so automatically bestows an Intimacy of terrified awe upon the supplicant (irresistible due to her voluntary submission).</li>
<li>Those who dare to gaze directly upon the Infernal&rsquo;s awful radiance forfeit their lives. Looking upon the warlock&rsquo;s face automatically inflicts Green Sun Wasting (targeting the Infernal while averting one&rsquo;s eyes imposes a -2 internal penalty).</li>
<li>Such is the mercy of Malfeas that the warlock sometimes does not destroy his vassals. The Infernal may shield up to a Magnitude of his Essence rating in individuals chosen at the time of activation, whether a single unit or a series of disparate individuals. The warlock may reflexively revoke this protection from anyone at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Essence 6+ repurchase affects dematerialized beings, upgrades the anima banner&rsquo;s size to (Essence x 100) yards, and increases its Damage to (Essence)B.</p>

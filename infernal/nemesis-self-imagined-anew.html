        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Ebon Dragon defeats adversaries by becoming their perfect antithesis. The Infernal chooses a living being he can perceive within (Essence rating) yards. The Exalt&rsquo;s Motivation changes to some antagonistic opposite of the target&rsquo;s own Motivation as a Shaping effect (so the target&rsquo;s &ldquo;Defend the Realm&rdquo; could change the Infernal to &ldquo;Destroy the Realm&rdquo; or &ldquo;Corrupt the Realm&rdquo;). Akuma temporarily gain this Motivation in addition to their Urge but can only select a character presenting a known obstacle to their Urge as a target for this Charm.</p>
<p>The Infernal knows the Motivation of the target. If that Motivation changes while the Charm remains active, the Infernal automatically shifts to oppose this new goal. When this Charm ends, the Exalt&rsquo;s Motivation reverts to what it was previously. The death of the enemy automatically ends the Charm. Completing the new Motivation also ends the Charm but doesn&rsquo;t afford a chance to bypass training time for raising Essence unless the target has an Essence rating greater than or equal to that of the Infernal.</p>
<p>This Charm also creates an Intimacy of spiteful hate in the Infernal toward the Charm&rsquo;s target. This Intimacy is inviolate while the Charm remains active.</p>
<p>Whenever the Infernal witnesses a social attack against the Charm&rsquo;s target that is aided or inhibited by one of the target&rsquo;s Intimacies, he recognizes this fact but does not know any details about the Intimacy. By reflexively spending one mote (which is not a Charm activation), the Infernal knows the Intimacy and instantly gains an Intimacy to the same subject with an opposing emotional context.</p>
<p>Infernals who learn and use <a class="complex" href="black-mirror-shintai.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Black Mirror Shintai'"><span class="link-focus">Black Mirror Shintai</span></a> (see pp. 154-155) automatically and reflexively reactivate Nemesis Self Imagined Anew when they cease mirroring a target. This does not require a Charm activation or follow normal range restrictions.</p>

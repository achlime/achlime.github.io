            <p>The warlock smiles or sobs, whichever may be appropriate to her transcendence, as the chains of the Yozis fall from her heart. She weaves a final Chrysalis Grotesque, which functions identically to that of this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite. Upon emerging, she subsumes her Unwoven Coadjutor, subtly reconfiguring her appearance to more directly express her own Infernal nature rather than that of a mere serf of the First Circle. More importantly, the warlock redefines her own Urge so that it permanently matches her Motivation.</p>
<p>The reins of Torment may be taken out of the hands of the Yozis, but they do not disappear altogether. The Infernal must define her own new Torment manifestation, using published Torments as a guideline. She continues to accumulate and reduce Limit in the normal manner; acting against the dictates of her own nature guides the Exalt&rsquo;s hellish Essence to viciously lash out against her.</p>

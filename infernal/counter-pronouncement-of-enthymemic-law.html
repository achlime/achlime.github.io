        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The law of Cecelyne is arbitrary. This is her prerogative, for the law serves only to maintain the power of the mighty over the weak. Faced with any sort of mental influence or an attempt to alter him with a Shaping effect, the Infernal may vocally retort by citing some law of Hell that contradicts the attacker&rsquo;s intentions and makes them illegal. The Infernal may make up a law on the spot, which need not be logical or consistent with previously established laws, though it cannot set the weak above the strong. It isn&rsquo;t necessary to draw attention to where the law comes from, though the Exalt may not misattribute it to another government.</p>
<p>The declaration of law provides a perfect parry against the rebuked mental influence or Shaping attempt, regardless of whether the law has any legitimate authority over the attacker. This includes written attacks, provided the character argues aloud with the text. Additionally, the Infernal and all First Circle demons who overhear the pronouncement must spend one Willpower or instantly develop an Intimacy of loyalty toward the new law as a Servitude effect. This Charm is vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Endless Desert.</p>

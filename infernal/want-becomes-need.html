            <p>As much fun as it can be to invert love into hate, there are other ways to ruin a memory. This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. By paying an extra mote while using that Charm, the Infernal seeks a different outcome. Ruining a memory doesn&rsquo;t take away the pleasure of it. Quite to the contrary, the subject gains fetishistic appeal that is at once a source of titillation and shame. This induced desire results in a positive Intimacy of addiction toward the subject (possibly overriding an existing positive Intimacy with another emotional context). Healing this variant of memory damage and Intimacy gain requires the same process as the basic function of Golden Years Tarnished Black.</p>
<p>With Essence 3+, Want Becomes Need does more than distort memory and foster shame-poisoned longings for remembered joys. If the attack succeeds, the twisted memory and poisonous Intimacy join together to addict her soul. Most victims suffer an unnatural Compulsion duplicating a constant partially-controlled Overindulgence Limit Break (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 105), though they may take scant consolation that the behavior is solely limited to the subject of the altered memories/Intimacy and does not predispose them to other vices. Victims can pay one Willpower to suppress this addictive behavior for one day. Victims with Limit tracks can choose to gain one Limit instead of paying Willpower to ignore the addiction for a day. If this results in madness wholly unconnected to addiction, well, Exalted are strange creatures.</p>
<p>The addictive Compulsion instilled by Want Becomes Need is predicated on both the memory distortion and the associated Intimacy. If either is removed or meaningfully altered at any point (as determined by the Storyteller), the addiction instantly terminates and never comes back without further use of Want Becomes Need.</p>

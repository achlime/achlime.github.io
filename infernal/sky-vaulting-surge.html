        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In her madness, the Silent Wind sometimes forgets the idea of <em>down</em>. This Charm may only be activated while moving at full dashing speed and deactivates if the warlock slows below this limit. For every action tick that passes for the Infernal while Sky-Vaulting Surge remains active, her player cumulatively records a +1 jump multiplier. So, if the character takes four Speed 3 dash actions in a row while using this Charm, her players records this as a +4 jump multiplier. If the Charm deactivates itself, the multiplier count resets back to zero and can only be reestablished with a sufficient running start. As soon as the Infernal next takes a standard jump action, Sky-Vaulting Surge deactivates and enhances that jump in the following ways: First, the jump does not penalize the warlock&rsquo;s DV and is not shortened by wound penalties or armor mobility penalties. Second, the distance the character can leap is ([Strength + Athletics] x Jump Multiplier) yards vertically or twice that distance horizontally. The jump multiplier can&rsquo;t exceed the warlock&rsquo;s (Athletics + Essence), regardless of how far she runs in advance of her leap. Finally, the Exalt suffers no falling damage from landing at the end of the jump, even if leaping from a very high perch where most of the descent is actual falling rather than controlled jumping.</p>

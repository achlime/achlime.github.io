        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Externalizing her cosmic might, the Infernal weaves a free-standing Chrysalis Grotesque out of thin air, which incubates a pulsating and unformed Essence core. (The Chrysalis has the same traits as in <a class="complex" href="the-flame-of-the-rising-phoenix.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'The Flame of the Rising Phoenix'"><span class="link-focus">The Flame of the Rising Phoenix</span></a>; it is destroyed if it suffers a single health level of damage.) Within the Chrysalis sleeps an inchoate demon of the Third Circle (which should be designed by the Infernal&rsquo;s player working together with the Storyteller). The Chrysalis will hatch and disgorge this demon once the Infernal has fed it (demon&rsquo;s desired Essence rating x 100) motes, to a maximum of Essence 9. It may absorb up to five motes per day. The demon, once born, forms seven Second Circle devas for itself, as normal.</p>
<p>This Charm cannot form a fetich soul for the Infernal; being possessed of a soul of her own, the warlock is above such weaknesses. Although demons created with this Charm are not obligated to obey their creator, they have significant incentive to protect her, as they will die if she does. As well, the created spirit has an Intimacy of loyalty toward the Infernal which may never be removed. This influence is mutual; the Infernal gains an Intimacy toward the demon&rsquo;s Motivation, which may not be removed while the demon lives. Demons created through this Charm act as an arcane link to their creator. They are immune to sorcerous summons, though not to banishment. If the Infernal knows <a class="complex" href="the-spirit-of-the-living-world.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'The Spirit of the Living World'"><span class="link-focus">The Spirit of the Living World</span></a>, banished demons are trapped inside the Infernal&rsquo;s soul for five days rather than being sent to Hell.</p>
<p>The Infernal may have up to (Willpower + Compassion) Third Circle demons created by this Charm in existence at a time.</p>

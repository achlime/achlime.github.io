        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In the time before Creation, the Great Mother was ancient beyond reckoning, with a vastness surpassed only by the Endless Desert, and fathoms deep such as she could swallow the unborn universe. All facets of Kimbery exalt Kimbery; all fathoms of her limitless depths exist to magnify and exude Kimbery and sing of her greatness. So it is with lesser waters to deify to the greatest of all oceans.</p>
<p>When the Infernal learns this Charm, she gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of twenty motes. Initially empty, it may be filled by the empowering hosannas of Primordial waters. This Charm may only be activated if surrounded by surface water on all sides for at least 100 yards. Doing so immediately calms the waters within (Essence x 500) yards. If a storm is raging in the area, it erodes gradually over the next ten ticks, until there is nothing but calm and eerie silence over the waters. In the midst of open sea, all waves vanish. A sufficiently large river will cease flowing. Currents lose their pull, and winds churn and whorl in loose vortices, making sails useless. Mundane vessels caught on such waters may only be moved manually (by use of oars) or by magical locomotion. But these doldrums are anything but lifeless.</p>
<p>The area of the effect then develops huge pulses of inner glow, as sickly yellow-green phosphorescent lights 30 yards wide rise to the surface like pustules on diseased skin. They churn, exude vapors, and strobe open and shut like great watching eyes, while the enormous shadows of alien nightmares rise up to swim just below the surface, turning calm waters into an ominous froth. Never cresting, these beasts can be seen only as shadows illuminated by eldritch glow—a manifestation of countless ancient horrors long since forgotten. Deep mournful lowing rises up from the depths. Soon it is followed by hundreds of intangible motonic fireflies which drift into the sky and can be seen for miles. Then the song begins, emanating from the collective voice of all aquatic existence: waves, wind, waters, and all the things living in them sing the song of Kimbery. This chant is in no known language, but listeners understand the words as a matter of instinct: Kimbery&rsquo;s greatness is unending, her power terrifying, her reach limitless, her love / hate (they are the same) boundless and inescapable.</p>
<p>Song of the Depths confers the following additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The warlock gains (Essence) offensive motes.</li>
<li>As long as she remains in the area of the effect, she gains two offensive motes per action.</li>
<li>Any beloved characters within the area of effect gain a single offensive mote per action, provided they have Overdrive pools.</li>
<li>The character may invoke What Lurks Beneath as an innate power, for a cost of 10 motes, if she knows that Charm.</li>
<li>Any offensive Charm the warlock uses against a reviled character is reduced in price by one mote, to a minimum of one mote, provided she pays the Charm&rsquo;s activation cost entirely from her Overdrive pool.</li>
<li>Characters within the Charm&rsquo;s range attacking subjects of the Infernal&rsquo;s hatred gain the above benefit. This effect may only be dispelled by casting Adamant Countermagic at the absolute center of the effect, or by succeeding with a Holy-enhanced Charisma + Presence attack against the effect itself, which has a dodge MDV equal to the warlock&rsquo;s. Lastly, Song of the Depths may be invoked as an innate power while the Infernal is using any Kimbery shintai, for a cost of 10 motes.</li>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In his torment, Malfeas sheds constant layers in a vain effort to expand past his oaths. The wholesale destruction of a single layer and its inhabitants to push out unwanted injury is as inconsequential as the natural shedding of dead skin. By use of this Charm, an Infernal confidently steps into the path of an attack and chooses for it to hit him full on. The deliberateness of his interposed self perfectly parries the attack regardless of whether it is normally blockable. This Charm can also defend against any environmental hazards (including falling), though it must be activated at each interval at which the hazard inflicts damage. This Charm is a form of parry, not a soak, so the attack doesn&rsquo;t count as having hit when it uselessly impacts the Infernal&rsquo;s body with a spray of sparks and brass shavings. This Charm suffers the Imperfection of the Demon City (see sidebar).</p>
<p>This Charm may not be activated against attacks the Infernal is not aware of. If used to defend against an attack that produces knockback, the Infernal automatically suffers the knockback effect, although all other damage or deleterious effects are negated.</p>

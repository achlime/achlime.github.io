        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A Green Sun Prince has only to breathe to assert absolute authority over her existence. This Charm provides protection against all unwanted Shaping effects. It creates an invisible Essence shield with (Integrity) layers, which act as health levels; whenever the character is subject to a Shaping effect, she rolls her (Essence + Willpower) against a difficulty of her opponent&rsquo;s Essence. The Storyteller determines the difficulty to resist Shaping not originating with another character, using the Wyld resistance chart on page 140 of <strong>The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II—The Wyld</strong> as a guideline. If she fails, her shield loses a layer; if she botches, all layers are lost and the Charm terminates. In either case, the Shaping fails to take effect and the warlock has the option of reflexively reactivating Emerald Angel Unfurling by repaying the activation cost. This does not count as a Charm activation.</p>
<p>Whenever the Infernal experiences any Shaping effect while using this Charm, her anima briefly flares into a mandala of emerald wings in number equal to her Integrity, making Emerald Angel Unfurling momentarily Obvious to observers. If she succeeds on the (Essence + Willpower) roll, the mandala simply fades. If her shield loses a layer, one of the wings develops a crack and falls to pieces before the mandala fades; if she botches the roll, the entire mandala shatters like a pane of glass.</p>
<p>At Essence 4+, the warlock&rsquo;s shield may not be tested by the pressures of Pure Chaos more than once per hour, and a break in her shield may not impose this roll anew on further activations of Emerald Angel Unfurling.</p>

Prerequisite Charms: Seeing is Blindness</p>
<p>The Ebon Dragon&rsquo;s touch brings unimaginable horror upon those foolish enough to oppose him. This Charm can enhance any ranged attack. If the attack hits a living being, the induced agony and paralysis imposes a -2 internal penalty to all rolled, non-reflexive physical actions, -1 to all static values (like DVs) and -2 yards from the distance natural movement can cover each tick for that victim for the rest of the scene. The total penalty from all uses of this Charm cannot reduce a rolled pool below the victim&rsquo;s Essence rating or (half Essence, rounded up) for static values, while Move and Dash actions use their normal limits for minimum speed. Victims of this Charm can lessen this curse&rsquo;s hold on themselves as a diceless Speed 5, DV -1 miscellaneous action costing five motes per activation removed, with no upper limit on expenditure, but this action can&rsquo;t be part of a flurry. Appropriate countermagic clears all activations away.</p>
<p>Each (Essence 3+) repurchase provides one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The activation cost decreases by one mote and the scope of the penalty expands to impede all non-reflexive actions. Lower-Essence victims automatically drop prone whenever struck by an attack enhanced with this Charm as a Knockback effect.</li>
<li>By paying an extra two motes, the warlock can use this Charm in Step 9 as a special Counterattack against an attacker within (Essence x 2) yards. Obvious serpentine emanations from his anima deliver the curse.</li>
</ul>

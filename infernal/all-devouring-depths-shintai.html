            <p>Kimbery&rsquo;s least shintai evokes the most ancient life that swam within her. In activating this Charm, the Infernal&rsquo;s acidic blood disintegrates her flesh completely and consumes her Essence, liquefying the totality of her being. The transubstantiation into green-black ichor doubles the overall volume of her body and provides the following powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>All worn and carried possessions are banished Elsewhere for the duration.</li>
<li>Her amorphous form can flow through any crack that isn&rsquo;t air-tight and her identity is unrecognizable. The Infernal&rsquo;s amorphous form halves the minimum damage of any attack (round down, but to no lower than one die) that does not use fire, lightning, or Essence blasts. Fire, lightning and directed Essence attacks (like implosion bow fire) harm her normally, as do weapons dipped in oil and lit aflame.</li>
<li>She gains all benefits of using <a class="complex" href="fathomless-poison-haven.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Fathomless Poison Haven'"><span class="link-focus">Fathomless Poison Haven</span></a>.</li>
<li>Her inchoate body grows tentacles identical to those created with Ichor Flux Tendrils (similarly capable of independent clinches). Severing these tentacles doesn&rsquo;t harm her. She regenerates all severed appendages each action tick.</li>
<li>Eyes of endless variety blink and glare across her body, letting her use All Things Betray as an innate power for free.</li>
<li>Contact with her body is an environmental hazard with the same statistics as her acid blood. Victims struck by her suffer one-time exposure, while those clinched steadily dissolve.</li>
<li>On each action tick, she can give herself one permanent mutation as a Desecration effect. All of these mutations dissolve when the Charm ends.</li>
<li>She flows through or over other liquids at her swimming speed. She flows over solid surfaces at her ground move speed without regard for gravity (such as by oozing up walls).</li>
</ul>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Whispering Flame finds it bitterly amusing that her peers saw fit to instate free will upon existence, while their jailers have done much work to reverse this decision. Upon touching a manse containing a material intelligence (MI) and activating this Charm, the warlock&rsquo;s mind races through the Essence lines of the construct to penetrate the MI&rsquo;s Integrity and overcome it with the force of her will. Roll the character&rsquo;s (Wits + Presence + Essence) against a difficulty of (Manse rating); add +2 to the difficulty if the manse was constructed by a being of Essence 6+, and another +2 if the manse was built by a Lawgiver. As the Solars were well aware of the powers of She Who Lives in Her Name, this Charm is unable to overcome the defenses of manses rated N/A.</p>
<p>If successful, the warlock gains possession of the material intelligence and may glean all the information it has memorized or which its owner has otherwise stored in it. The Infernal also gains access to all the manse&rsquo;s controls, including its security systems, monitoring abilities, and integrated weaponry, and may use these advantages as she wishes. However, so long as the Infernal is in possession of the MI, she is obligated to obey any commands its controller gives to it, so long as they are within its scope. Orders given directly to the warlock may be ignored.</p>
<p>The Infernal may also possess automatons, warstriders with animating intelligences, hellstriders and other hellforged wonders, and the flickering, half-dead embers of existence which gutter in the husks of victims hollowed out by the Fair Folk, as these are also a sort of hollow mind. In the case of all but the last, use the rules for invading a manse&rsquo;s MI, but replace Manse with Artifact to determine difficulty. The Infernal automatically succeeds in possessing the dream-eaten. Hollow Mind Possession may never be used to control the animated dead, for the Whispering Flame makes no place for the aberrations of the Underworld in the perfect hierarchy</p>
<p>When the character controls a being via this Charm, she gains access to its full faculties and powers and may mentally order it to do as she wishes. She may only control one such being at a time. While doing so she suffers a -3 internal penalty to all physical actions taken by her own body.</p>
<p>Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 4+ allows the Infernal to possess a valid target she can perceive by standing on the same paved road as that target, or by touching a man-made wall that the target is also touching. In this case, her psychic filter catches the current of the dragon lines moving through the construction and uses it as a vector to infect her target. A third purchase of this Charm at Essence 5+ allows a warlock standing in a demesne or manse to use this Charm on any manse within (Essence x 20) miles of her.</p>
<p>After relinquishing possession, this Charm automatically leaves a backdoor which allows the warlock to possess her target remotely with no roll. This backdoor is Sorcerous and can be removed accordingly, but will not exorcise the Infernal if she is sitting in possession at the time.</p>
<p>Finally, targets possessed with this Charm are always improved by the experience. The dreameaten begin to heal, developing Motivations, and Intimacies and personalities matching the possessing character, while material intelligences may become self-aware as a result of being inhabited by the warlock&rsquo;s illimitable mind. Occasionally She Who Lives in Her Name is able to see out through holes in her prison. Once or twice she has sent her will up the dragon lines into the material intelligences of Creation. Though she was never able to penetrate I AM&rsquo;s defenses, she was given to converse with that being on frequent occasions by use of a backdoor. More recently she came into possession of a material intelligence which plays a tremendous game of Gateway.</p>

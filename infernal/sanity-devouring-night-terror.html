        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm upgrades its prerequisite. If the Exalt has an Overdrive pool, offensive motes in this pool are not lost upon scene change to enter the arena of nightmare: the Infernal Monster enters the dreamscape with his full offensive might intact. Furthermore, this Charm generates fictitious shades of the victim&rsquo;s positive Intimacies all across the dream world. These characters are completely oblivious to the circumstances surrounding their arrival in the dream world, and will perfectly ignore any magical attempts to persuade or influence their behavior.</p>
<p>The dreamscapes will patch themselves around these characters, creating scenes which are intimate to the victim. The victim might find himself wandering down a dark tunnel full of jagged rocks only to emerge into the kitchen of his long dead mother, who will appear to be alive, well, and busily preparing his breakfast. These representations of the victim&rsquo;s Intimacies are not hollow illusions to be laughed off or ignored. Even though the victim knows they cannot possibly be real, each has all the seeming of the people he most loves. They are, in fact, externally generated from within his heart, so he is completely unable to ignore the urge to protect or defend these characters unless he pays a point of Willpower to ignore the Infernal&rsquo;s unnatural Illusion, separately and for each Intimacy that he wishes to abandon. However, doing so in the dream also revokes this Intimacy from his heart when the nightmare ends.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the presence of these Intimacies leaves the victim vulnerable. Unlike the real figures they represent, they do not possess the combat traits or magical powers they may actually possess in real life. They will act in a manner befitting their motivations, but will interact with the horrific, external presence of nightmarish dreamscapes and the presence of a monster only if directly confronted with evidence of these things. Otherwise, mom will ignore a victim who is being beaten to death in the adjacent cave; as in nightmare, the figments of the dreamer&rsquo;s heart seem only to exist in the small, familiar scenes in which they are placed within the dream.</p>
<p>Of course, letting them off the hook would be too easy. If directly confronted by the Infernal Monster, they will attempt to flee or fight as accurate to their nature. However, having no actual traits or magic, each victim represents no greater threat status to the Infernal Monster than an extra. Killing a target&rsquo;s Intimacies while forcing him to watch grants the Infernal Monster (Essence) motes to his Overdrive pool, if he has one. Each slaughtered Intimacy also redefines itself with a context of tortured guilt when the dreamer awakens. As a final piece of advice, Gorol was the first Infernal Monster stylist to discover, to his detriment, the special interaction between Sanity-Devouring Night Terror and the Solar Charm <a class="complex" href="../solar/visage-made-law.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Visage Made Law'"><span class="link-focus">Visage Made Law</span></a> (see <strong>Lords of Creation</strong> (with errata), p. 80-81). If one of the victim&rsquo;s positive Intimacies have learned that Charm, his appearance in the dream will no longer be as an extra, but rather will carry his actual traits, Charms, panoply, and any other magic the character knows. In this way, Gorol was defeated when he attempted a dream assault on the Lunar wife of one of his most hated Solar enemies.</p>

            <p>Overdrive, Shaping, Touch
Duration: Instant
Prerequisite Charms: First Ebon Dragon Excellency, Our Little Secret</p>
<p>The Ultimate Darkness knows no greater pleasure than to shatter the mighty, break the hearts of heroes, and bring mortality to those who seemed invincible. Upon learning this Charm, the character gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, the Fiend may only fill it by acting as the architect of another man&rsquo;s ruin.</p>
<p>In order to use this Charm against a particular target, the warlock must first mark at least one character to whom the target has a positive Intimacy with the effect of Our Little Secret (see <strong>Ink Monkeys, Vol. 7</strong>). The Intimacy must have a strong emotional context, such as love or friendship, and the effect of the warlock&rsquo;s trigger of Our Little Secret must still be intact (the target has not spent Willpower or used Charms to break their silence about the horror they have witnessed).</p>
<p>The Infernal touches his target and pays five motes to activate this Charm. The target immediately intuits that some great harm has befallen each affected loved one as an Obvious effect. This does not reveal the details of Our Little Secret or the exact nature of the harm that has been done to each victim. At this juncture, the character also understands that he may allow full knowledge of what has transpired to enter his consciousness. By doing so, he explicitly agrees to allow the effects of this Charm through his Shaping defenses (if any). If he chooses not to allow this dread knowledge to reveal itself to him, he must spend one Willpower to resist immediately running from the scene to fly to the aid of his loved ones. Spending Willpower to resist this unnatural Compulsion always grants characters with the Great Curse a point of Limit, even if they have already gained Limit for resisting unnatural mental influence during the scene.</p>
<p>If the target does allow himself to see The Face in the Darkness, he witnesses each and every depravity the warlock has forced his loved ones to endure in silence. This tragic and horrifying sequence of sounds and images plays through the target&rsquo;s mind instantly, but he experiences it in painstaking detail, standing helplessly and intangibly by as each of his loved ones are victimized. This cruel and deliberate show of atrocity has the following side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target gains an Intimacy of hatred to the Infernal on the spot.</li>
<li>If the target had any Overdrive motes, he loses a number of them equal to the number of victims revealed to him. The warlock adds five times this number of offensive motes to his Overdrive pool.</li>
<li>The target feels emasculated by the harm done to his loved ones, and is unable to channel his Virtues for the rest of the scene as a Crippling effect.</li>
<li>For the rest of the scene, if the target gains offensive motes to his Overdrive pool, any gains are reduced by a single mote, to a minimum of zero. Motes lost enter the warlock&rsquo;s Overdrive pool on the same tick.</li>
</ul>

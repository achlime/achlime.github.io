        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>She Who Lives in Her Name is sometimes benevolent in her schemes against gods and man. More than revenge, she savors the opportunity to prove that her enemies need her. This Charm functions identically to <a class="complex" href="../solar/essence-lending-method.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Essence-Lending Method'"><span class="link-focus">Essence-Lending Method</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 217) save for the following changes:</p>
<p>The warlock need not touch her subject. She may simply will the power into a character she can perceive up to a mile away. She may transfer up to (Essence x 5) motes in this fashion. If both she and her target have Overdrive pools, she may transfer motes from her Overdrive pool into her subject&rsquo;s Overdrive pool. She may also transfer Essence from her default personal or peripheral mote pools into her Overdrive pool, or the Overdrive pool of another, at a rate of three regular motes per every one offensive mote. As with Essence-Lending Method, these transfers do not contribute to anima displays. Finally, if the warlock is lending Essence to a hierarchical superior in an organization to which she belongs (such as the Whispering Flame to the Primordial King), she may Lease the Flame without spending Willpower.</p>

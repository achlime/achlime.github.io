        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>To properly oppose an enemy, the Shadow of All Things must learn to fight as that enemy does. This Charm may only be activated while Nemesis Self Imagined Anew is active. Doing so reveals what Abilities the target has with a higher rating than the Infernal but doesn&rsquo;t reveal the actual ratings of these traits. He may choose any such Ability and temporarily gains one dot of that trait. Subsequent activations can stack additional bonus dots onto the same or different valid Abilities, up to the Infernal&rsquo;s usual maximum for that trait. Costs for raising traits boosted through this Charm are based on the Infernal&rsquo;s normal rating but ignore training times.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm extends the scope of traits it can mimic to Attributes (for a cost of six motes per dot gained) and permanent Willpower (for a cost of five motes per dot gained). The latter use does not provide additional temporary Willpower on activation.</p>
<p>A third purchase at Essence 4+ allows the character to copy one of the target&rsquo;s Charms for six motes. Charms that provide additional Essence reserves can&rsquo;t be copied. The Infernal can only choose a Charm that the target has used previously in the scene, though not necessarily via activation. For example, <a class="complex" href="../solar/ox-body-technique.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Ox-Body Technique'"><span class="link-focus">Ox-Body Technique</span></a> is always in use. At the time of use, the target must have been within (Essence x 5) yards of the Infernal, and the Charm must have been Obvious to the Infernal&rsquo;s senses at the time of use. The copied Charm must be one that the character is capable of learning and for which he has all necessary prerequisites and minimum traits.</p>
<p>Green Sun Princes of the Fiend Caste may draw upon their anima power to broaden the scope of Charms they can copy with the third purchase of Puissance Mimicry Intuition, though Charms that can only be gained this way cost seven motes apiece. Non-Fiends may copy foreign Charms at Essence 5+ but lack the power to permanently retain such magic with experience. The Storyteller may veto or limit any Charm acquisitions that present unforeseen problems or imbalances.</p>

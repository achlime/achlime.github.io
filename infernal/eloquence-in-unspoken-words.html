        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal swallows her voice, consuming that which is most antithetical to blessed quiet. She loses the ability to make any vocal utterances except laughter, but the sacrifice purifies her words and gives them nobler means of expression. The mental voice granted by this Charm can address a specific Intelligence 1+ being the Infernal can perceive within 100 yards, or it can broadcast to all such minds within the radius. Recipients hear the Infernal&rsquo;s voice within their mind and recognize that the telepathic speech comes from a nonspecific external source, though those who have heard the Exalt speak will recognize the same inflections. This form of communication can&rsquo;t be overheard without magic dedicated to the purpose. The Charm may communicate only in Old Realm, and is useless to those who cannot speak it.</p>
<p>Characters who wish to tune out all transmissions from every activation of this Charm may do so for a day by spending one Willpower. This is considered resisting unnatural mental influence. If an Infernal has any Virtues rated at 5 dots, listeners with the same rating in that Virtue can understand the key nuances of the Exalt&rsquo;s words enough to derive meaningful comprehension without knowing Old Realm. This Charm lasts until the Exalt reactivates it.</p>

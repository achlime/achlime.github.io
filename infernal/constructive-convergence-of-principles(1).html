        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Primordials built Creation from the chaos of the Wyld. Tapping into this legacy, an Infernal with Constructive Convergence of Principles may give form to the inchoate. Except as noted, this Charm duplicates the Solar Charm <a class="complex" href="../solar/wyld-shaping-technique.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Wyld-Shaping Technique'"><span class="link-focus">Wyld-Shaping Technique</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 216) and is similarly limited to Shaping within a radius of (Essence) miles. Unlike the Lawgivers, the dice pool for this Charm is (Willpower + Essence). This action may be enhanced by the Excellencies of She Who Lives in Her Name as though the dice pool was a combination of (Attribute + Ability). All beings created by this Charm are inherently creatures of darkness in accordance with the Yozi Essence that gave them life. Spending successes equal to a First Circle demon&rsquo;s Essence rating on the &ldquo;create people&rdquo; option allows the Exalt to spawn an unbound heroic member of that race that comes into existence with an Intimacy of loyalty to its creator and whatever Motivation he decides to imprint on it. This Charm may be used in the Demon Realm as though the Middlemarches, but the Yozis are very touchy about having their bodies mutilated by Exalted, so one will actively block efforts to Shape any modifications to its terrain unless the changes closely fit the Yozi&rsquo;s nature and aesthetic. The broken Primordials are indifferent to the creation of wealth, people or artifacts within themselves.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ upgrades it with all of the effects bestowed by <a class="complex" href="../solar/wyld-cauldron-technology.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Wyld Cauldron Technology'"><span class="link-focus">Wyld Cauldron Technology</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 217). A third purchase at Essence 5+ allows regions of Creation to be shaped as if the Bordermarches, though demesnes can&rsquo;t be formed within Creation until the Infernal has Essence 7+, and all must have an Infernal aspect. Use of this Charm in Creation is a Blasphemy effect.</p>

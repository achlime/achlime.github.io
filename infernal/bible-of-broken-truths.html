        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Ebon Dragon knows his own nature well enough to realize he is too often distracted tormenting individuals to properly damn the universe. Accordingly, he sends forth blasphemous revisionist texts into Creation as messengers of his lies. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal permanently gains the power to use Golden Years Tarnished Black to enhance written social attacks matching the Charm&rsquo;s basic spoken use.</p>
<p>All that is necessary is for the words to clearly invoke the intended topic. Terse graffiti is just as useful for delivering the attack as a lengthier project like a novel or history textbook. Both Presence and Performance-based attacks are permissible, with the latter taking the form of general addresses to any reader. Text enchanted with this Charm is no more physically durable than normal, so fire remains an excellent countermeasure to most cursed writing.</p>
<p>The magic within the words is also a Sorcerous effect and can be dispelled as such, causing the text to fade away as though never written. Even stone tablets become unmarred and smooth once more as chiseled words disappear. Few realize that the empty page is the truest and most eloquent scripture of the Ebon Dragon. Of all his lies, the titan&rsquo;s insistence that he exists is the most audacious and preposterous.</p>

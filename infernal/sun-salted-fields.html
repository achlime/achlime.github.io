        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Though the Green Sun of the primeval epoch once nourished the land and life, the heart of Malfeas is mad and terrible, poisoned against all he once ruled. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal&rsquo;s anima radiates a burst of Malfean Essence that fills a radius of 50 yards. Normal senses can&rsquo;t detect this burst, though Essence users feel a characteristic, nauseating tingle as long as they remain among the lingering energies. Essence-based perception instantly recognizes the burst as if the Charm were Obvious.</p>
<p>In its passage, the burst poisons the air, the land and even space itself. The healthy green of foliage sickens unnaturally over the span of a week with a fine patina of tarnish on every leaf. Any being that isn&rsquo;t native to Malfeas must check for exposure to Green Sun Wasting (see p. 110) every full hour that they spend within the blight at a Virulence of the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence rating. Each day that passes reduces the disease&rsquo;s Virulence by 1 until it fades completely and the area becomes healthy again. Whenever an Infernal who knows this Charm dies, she may reflexively bathe her surroundings in blight as per Sun-Salted Fields with no cost as a final act of spite.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spinning orbs of She Who Lives In Her Name have no hands with which to grapple and impose order on the world. They are not so crude. With this Charm active, the Infernal may move other objects with his mind as though manipulating them with his own body, exerting force or even lifting objects and carrying them through the air at speeds up to his own current velocity. His telekinesis trails Obvious ripples of spatial distortion and white light as prehensile tendrils of mental force. This Charm has a Dexterity equal to his Willpower and a Strength equal to his Essence. The associated Ability to use this Charm is Occult, whether for attacking with direct force or hurling objects, or to determine effective (Strength + Athletics) total for a mind-powered feat of strength. If a floating weapon is wielded this way, the Ability is the lower rating of the normal trait and Occult, and all actions using the weapon suffer a -3 external penalty. Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, the Essence for this Charm must be committed, but the effect may also be terminated at will by ending this commitment. Mind-Hand Manipulation can move perceived incorporeal beings and objects, but its effective Strength is halved.</p>
<p>Moving objects with Mind-Hand Manipulation requires the same actions as doing so normally. All actions suffer range penalties like an attack with a range interval of (Willpower + Essence). Objects that have been lifted into the air fall when the action taken to move them ends, though up to (Essence) separate objects may be held stationary between actions, reflexively levitated through force of will. Grabbing anything that resists requires a clinch attack, but opponents who win control of a clinch do not get to grapple the Exalt and may only choose to escape. Moreover, clinches can only be maintained with renewed control rolls as normal, so victims can&rsquo;t be held aloft with merely reflexive effort. Unlike most ranged attacks, telekinesis granted by this Charm may be used defensively to deflect projectiles and weaken blows, as represented by the parry option provided by the Charm&rsquo;s Defense rating.</p>
<p>Infernals with Essence 3+ add a third attack option, in which they can focus their mental force to scalpel sharpness with which to vivisect those who displease or intrigue them. Repurchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ allows an Infernal to spend one Willpower whenever a telekinetic attack would inflict two or more actual levels of damage. Invoking this power replaces all damage with a Crippling amputation of the Exalt&rsquo;s choice (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 152, for examples). Such injuries self-seal as though cauterized and do not even bleed. Telekinetically wielded weapons can&rsquo;t amputate victims this way.</p>
<p><strong>Telekinetic Blow:</strong> Speed 5, Accuracy (Willpower + Occult), Damage (Essence)B, Defense (Willpower + Occult), Rate (Essence, max 5), Range (Willpower + Essence), and Overwhelming 2</p>
<p><strong>Telekinetic Clinch:</strong> Speed 6, Accuracy (Willpower + Occult), Damage (Essence)B, Rate 1, Range (Willpower + Essence), and Overwhelming 2</p>
<p><strong>Telekinetic Blade:</strong> As Telekinetic Blow, but Damage (Essence)L piercing (aggravated to creatures of the Wyld).</p>

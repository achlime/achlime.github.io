        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Kimbery is The Sea That Marched Against the Flame. But did she win? Each purchase of this Charm provides one of the revelations listed below, a truth seared into the Great Mother by her first nemesis. The options list forbidden and mandatory actions. The warlock ignores all mental influence as an unacceptable order if it seeks to make her perform a forbidden action or refrain from mandatory action. Unfortunately, the Infernal can&rsquo;t voluntarily take forbidden actions or fail to act as directed unless she pays Willpower equal to her Essence (maximum 5) to hypocritically override the Charm&rsquo;s unnatural Compulsion for a day. Even if this cost is paid, the Charm&rsquo;s defense against external influence remains. When different Compulsions clash, the Storyteller chooses which has preeminence. Each revelation also confers a unique power.</p>

        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Mother Before Daughter</h4>:</span>
        <p>The Infernal can&rsquo;t knowingly betray beloved characters or ancestors from whom she descends (i.e. parents, grandparents, etc.). Betrayal means a course of action or inaction that she believes will result in more harm than good. When making rolls to navigate anywhere or track a beloved character, she adds bonus successes equal to the number of beloved characters she has.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="trust-is-naive">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Trust Is Naïve</h4>:</span>
        <p>The Infernal refuses to believe anything bad about a beloved character. At best, she can be persuaded that such a character is a victim who has been duped into poor decisions by the wickedness of others. She requires only a single scene of action or persuasion to build a positive Intimacy toward anyone she has never reviled.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="existence-is-agony">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Existence Is Agony</h4>:</span>
        <p>The Infernal can&rsquo;t show mercy. She may spare an enemy, but only with the intent to prolong his suffering. If multiple courses of action seem to offer roughly equivalent benefit to herself, she must choose the path she believes will maximize harm to non-beloved characters along the way. Compassion 3+ no longer compels her to care about anyone except beloved characters, though she may magnanimously choose to care about strangers in hopes of making them beloved.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="never-forgive">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Never Forgive</h4>:</span>
        <p>The Infernal cannot abandon or weaken a negative Intimacy toward reviled characters and refuses to believe anything good about them. When she makes a social attack encouraging others to think ill of a reviled character (Emotion and/or Illusion) or harm a reviled character (Compulsion), her words become unnatural mental influence.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="hate-springs-eternal">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Hate Springs Eternal</h4>:</span>
        <p>The Infernal can&rsquo;t knowingly help a reviled character unless she believes her own life depends on it. Her great heart can still sustain (Willpower + Compassion) positive Intimacies without risk of losing them through sleep, but negative Intimacies do not count against this limit and never fall off that way. Additionally, she adds +1 to her DV and MDV against the attacks of reviled characters; manifest loathing shields her even against enemies too foolish to fear her.</p>

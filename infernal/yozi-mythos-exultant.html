        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Yozis revel in the exercise of their purview, drawing power from the very strategies they use to spread that power through Creation. This Charm may be purchased once for each First (Yozi) Excellency the character knows, though she can only enhance a given action with one of the versions. Whenever the Infernal succeeds while stunting on an action that could benefit from the appropriate Excellency, she may choose to receive the alternate rewards listed below instead. Characters may partake of these awards even if they did not use the pertinent Excellency to assist the action, just so long as doing so was an option.</p>
<p><strong>Malfeas:</strong> Exercising unrestrained force stokes the flames at the heart of the Demon City, doubling any motes awarded for the successful stunt. Any motes granted by Malfeas Mythos Exultant are attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Infernal may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</p>
<p><strong>Cecelyne:</strong> The Endless Desert is a creature of balance, forming the dividing line between Creation and Malfeas, the finite and infinite. A successful two or three point stunt provides Willpower in addition to motes, rather than forcing the character to select one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>She Who Lives In Her Name:</strong> The flame-filled spheres of the Transcendent Hierarchy know their purpose, individually and especially jointly as part of a greater identity. The Infernal doubles any Willpower points awarded by the stunt.</p>
<p><strong>Adorjan:</strong> The Silent Wind defines her path as a field of opposition over which she must scour her legend. Her passage is death. One perceived target within (Essence) yards suffers dice of unsoakable lethal damage equal to the stunt rating from flensing breezes that swirl around him. Magical beings may reduce the raw damage by one die per three motes spent, sheltering their souls within an ablative layer of Essence. The Infernal can manifest the flensing wind only when she receives a stunt reward.</p>
<p><strong>Ebon Dragon:</strong> The Shadow of All Things is an unstoppable force of antagonism. Unlike the permutations of other Yozis, the Ebon Dragon&rsquo;s version of this Charm may enhance the stunt itself rather than its reward, converting the bonus dice into bonus successes. The Infernal may choose to convert any stunt dice he receives to automatic successes. Each die converted lowers his next stunt reward by one mote (minimum zero). He cannot choose a Willpower reward if he has converted any dice with this Charm.</p>

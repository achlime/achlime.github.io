        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Love is transient and absurd. Since Adorjan cannot often convince the world of love&rsquo;s transience, her lessons chiefly focus on absurdity. This Charm upgrades Tragic Love Amusement when used to instill Intimacies in others through Wind- Carried Passion in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the victim has Compassion 3+, he must suppress his Compassion for a scene of deliberate effort to count toward weakening the Intimacy.</li>
<li>The first time the victim perceives the object of the created Intimacy each day counts as (victim&rsquo;s Compassion rating) scenes repairing any damage to the Intimacy unless he spends three Willpower to resist this unnatural mental influence. Once the Intimacy is fully eroded, it ceases to replenish itself this way.</li>
<li>Once the Infernal has successfully created an Intimacy of love in another character with Tragic Love Amusement, she can spend a point of Willpower to terminate that Intimacy. This is an unblockable, undodgeable social attack that instantly functions without a roll across all distance and realms of existence. As the Intimacy vanishes, the victim regains a Compassion channel and is permitted to delete his memories of the Intimacy&rsquo;s object as if he had used Freedom Lets Go.</li>

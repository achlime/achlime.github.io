        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As the haunter activates this horrid power, darkness flows from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth, coating his body in the impenetrable black that exists at the event horizon of the Abyss. This blackness completely obscures the character&rsquo;s features, though it clings to his body and trails faint streamers in its wake as the character moves.</p>
<p>For the rest of the scene, dozens of jet-black tendrils lash out from the character&rsquo;s tenebrous body in a five-yard radius to attack anyone nearby. The haunter&rsquo;s player rolls a single (Strength + Martial Arts) attack, against which every character in the radius must defend him- or herself. (These tendrils do not distinguish between friend and foe.) Each such attack roll counts as a (Speed 6, DV -1) action. A successful attack inflicts (Strength + 2) levels of lethal damage. If such an attack strikes a victim down to Incapacitated or below, several of the tendrils wrap around the fallen target in the next action and drag her toward the attacking ghost&rsquo;s black body. Doing so takes two independent miscellaneous actions (meaning the other tendrils continue to attack as normal). A character can attempt to pull a downed comrade free of the tendrils, engaging in a contested Strength roll with the haunter—all while dodging the other tendrils&rsquo; attacks, of course. If someone does not rescue a fallen character in the space of two miscellaneous actions, the fallen character is dragged into the attacking ghost&rsquo;s body as if that ghost&rsquo;s silhouette were a hole in space itself. If the victim is pulled through that hole in space, she is cast into the Abyss.</p>
<p>While a haunter uses this Charm, he&rsquo;s not entirely in control of himself. He becomes an extension of the death wish of the Neverborn who orbit the threshold of dissolution, wanting only to pull in and devour anything that resists the call of Oblivion. The most he can do of his own will is cover distance at his normal Move or Dash speeds. Otherwise, he cannot attack targets himself, nor can he defend himself. Although the tendrils&rsquo; attacks use his traits, they act only on the blind idiot volition of the Neverborn. Fortunately, although the ghost cannot dodge or parry attacks made against him, the tenebrous shell of Oblivion that surrounds him adds 6L/12B to his soak and a like amount of Hardness. Also, if a weapon is not made of one of the magical materials or is not otherwise supernaturally enhanced, it inflicts bashing damage against the character using this Charm. (Note, the weapon, not the attack, must be supernaturally enhanced.)</p>
<p>If a ghost is destroyed while using this Charm, he implodes and plummets into the Abyss.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is a well-known fact that items buried with the dead materialize in the Underworld as grave goods, crystallizing from the strange Essence of that realm as exact copies of their living-world counterparts. Using this Charm, a ghostly artisan makes grave goods&rsquo; Essence malleable, allowing him to reshape such items into new forms. He can add supplementary materials to the new item for support or decoration, so long as he doesn&rsquo;t exceed 10 percent of the original object&rsquo;s mass. He can also break the original object down into smaller individual items, so long as each new item consists of no more than 90 percent of the original material. As long as he abides by those restrictions, he can fashion a completely new and fully functional item (or set of items) from the original&rsquo;s materials. The resulting item(s) retain any magical properties the original had, though every individual piece in a matching set made from a single item must be together for those magical properties to function.</p>
<p>Changing a single grave goods item into a new form takes seven days per dot of the Grave Goods Background the original item represents. The ghost may spend the required Essence in a lump sum up front or spread the cost out day by day. He may pay off the balance at any time.</p>

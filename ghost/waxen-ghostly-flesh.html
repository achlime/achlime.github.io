        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm makes possible any cosmetic change the ghost can imagine. With it, the ghost can change his height, girth, tone, color and appearance in any way he sees fit. He is capable of any change on the spectrum of human variation and beyond. As the ghost spends the requisite Essence, he pushes and pulls on his features, molding them like clay. With concentration, he can change the color of his flesh in any way he pleases, even adding an iridescent sheen to its surface. The ghost can even add inhuman features or hide human characteristics.</p>
<p>Using this Charm requires a (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll. (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The difficulty varies based on the complexity of the change. Changing one&rsquo;s skin, hair or eye color is difficulty 1. Changing a facial feature is difficulty 2. Altering one&rsquo;s body shape is difficulty 3. Fashioning a nonhuman feature is difficulty 4. Any change imaginable is possible, though with certain restrictions. The primary consideration is that the ghost must reshape himself into a form with a roughly equivalent mass as his original form. Second, the ghost cannot grant himself natural weapons, natural armor or superhuman capabilities. The ghost can reshape his arms into wings, but that won&rsquo;t allow him to fly. He can change his narrow mouth into a gaping lamprey maw, but his bite attacks inflict no more damage than usual. Finally, the new form must remain roughly humanoid. The ghost cannot use this Charm to literally transform himself into a ghostly animal or a chair or what have you.</p>
<p>At the end of the scene, the ghost&rsquo;s reshaped corpus flows back into its original shape. The ghost can forestall this automatic transformation for one hour by spending a Willpower point. Every hour thereafter, the ghost may spend another Willpower point to forestall the change for a subsequent hour. The Essence he spent to affect the change remains committed until the duration lapses.</p>

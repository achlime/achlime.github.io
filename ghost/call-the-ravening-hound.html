        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>If a ghost is in trouble, is very confident or is a villain bent on causing havoc, she can use this Charm to summon nearby hungry ghosts. As the player rolls (Manipulation + Presence), the ghost throws back her head and lets out a terrible, shrieking howl that can be heard as far away as the successes on the roll indicate. Any ghost who has this Charm recognizes the sound, as will any character in whose presence the Charm has been used before.</p>
<p>When this horrible call goes out, every hungry ghost in range stops what it&rsquo;s doing and howls in response— as a miscellaneous action, when that&rsquo;s relevant. Those nearest the one who sent out the call, up to a maximum determined by successes on the roll, then turn and make all due haste toward the origin of the summons. (If only one or a small handful of hungry ghosts from a larger pack bolt, the others might follow as well.)</p>
<p>The number of successes on the activation roll determine the range over which the call can be heard and the number of hungry ghosts compelled to respond as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 success: 100 yards, 1 hungry ghost</li>
<li>2 successes: 250 yards, 2 hungry ghosts</li>
<li>3 successes: 500 yards, 4 hungry ghosts</li>
<li>4 successes: one mile, 8 hungry ghosts</li>
<li>5+ successes: five miles, 20 hungry ghosts</li>
</ul>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A ghost with more training in this Arcanos can apply more vigilance to a Fetter than this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite allows. With Death-Avoiding Monitor, the ghost concentrates on the important person or object and spends the motes and Willpower to activate the Charm. (The Fetter need not be in her presence at the time.) The player then rolls (Perception + Temperance). If the roll succeeds, the character gains an ongoing background awareness of the subject&rsquo;s condition. She need only think about the Fetter to be informed of its condition.</p>
<p>This awareness lasts for one week. If the Fetter is a physical object, the ghost is aware of whether and how it is altered, damaged, repaired or destroyed. If the Fetter is a person, the ghost knows about changes in the person&rsquo;s condition including injury, illness, death, pregnancy or significant changes in emotional makeup. Spending one experience point at the time of activation extends this Charm&rsquo;s duration to one year. Spending two experience points makes the effect permanent. The character can activate Death- Avoiding Monitor as many ongoing concurrent times as she can afford, but she can check in on only one Fetter at a time.</p>
<p>The Essence that empowers this Charm is committed if the ghost uses it for the standard one-week duration. If the player spends experience points to extend the duration, however, that Essence is no longer committed.</p>

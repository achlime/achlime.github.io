        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Venting her rage on the world around her, the ghost causes loose objects to rise into the air and swirl at dangerous speeds in a five-yard radius. A single success on a (Conviction + Melee) roll activates this Charm and sustains the whirlwind until the character&rsquo;s next action. Additional successes can either increase the radius of the effect by five yards or increase the duration of the effect by five ticks. Once the ghost has set the storm in motion and set its size and duration, she may act normally on subsequent actions.</p>
<p>The number of successes on the activation roll also count as a number of attack successes against which anyone caught in the whirlwind must defend himself every five ticks that the whirlwind remains in effect. Anyone who can&rsquo;t successfully defend himself suffers four dice of damage. (The predominant type of debris determines the type of damage.)</p>
<p>The Obvious keyword applies only when the ghost is corporeal and visible when she activates this Charm. The whirlwind itself is still very much in evidence if an immaterial ghost activates the Charm, but if the ghost is not detectable by mundane senses, the source of the flying detritus is not self-evident.</p>

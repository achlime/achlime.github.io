        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When sentient beings such as ghosts, gods, demons or Exalts channel and store Essence within them, it affects the color of the aura they emanate. When a ghost learns this Charm, he trains himself to perceive and interpret a being&rsquo;s aura, granting him an idea of how much Essence is currently stored within that being. Doing so requires a successful (Perception + Larceny) roll.</p>
<p>A ghost using this Charm cannot share his aura-perception with anyone else—other than just describing what he sees. He can read the aura of any being in his presence, regardless of ambient light, as long as he already knows the being is there. The Charm&rsquo;s effective range is equal to the character&rsquo;s entire field of vision. If a being is committing motes to an item or an effect, those committed motes count toward the total for as long as the being maintains the commitment. Items do not emit their own auras, however, even if they are innately magical or attuned to target beings. The color visible in the aura reveals the number of motes the being contains, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black: 0 motes</li>
<li>Indigo: 1-5 motes</li>
<li>Green: 6-10 motes</li>
<li>Yellow: 11-20 motes</li>
<li>Orange: 21-40 motes</li>
<li>Red: 41+ motes</li>
</ul>

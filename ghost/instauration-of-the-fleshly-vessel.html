            <p>Rot is one of those unavoidable inconveniences nemissaries have to deal with on the job. With this Charm, however, they can repair damage caused by violence or natural decay. Every four motes of Essence the ghost spends reverses one day&rsquo;s worth of rot. As described under Nemissary&rsquo;s Ride, an exposed corpse degrades day by day after a grace period determined by the climate. Four motes spent to empower this Charm repairs damage caused by one day&rsquo;s post-grace-period decay. It can also roll back that grace-period countdown. With enough motes, a character can return a badly decayed corpse to the pristine condition it was in the moment after it died. To use this aspect of the Charm, the ghost must be possessing the corpse already, rebuilding it from within.</p>
<p>The second aspect of this Charm allows a ghost to heal damage the corpse sustains while she&rsquo;s in possession of it, though at the painful expense of her corpus. For the cost of only one mote, the ghost can dissolve one health level of her own body to repair one health level of damage to her corpse vessel. The damage can be bashing or lethal; the type she heals is the type she takes. The ghost cannot use this Charm to heal damage from aggravated sources, from fire or from magic that specifically ruins undead flesh—such as <a class="complex" href="../solar/blazing-solar-bolt.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Blazing Solar Bolt'"><span class="link-focus">Blazing Solar Bolt</span></a> or the <a class="complex" href="../solar/essence-arrow-attack.html#dazzling-flare" title="canonical entry of additional effect 'Dazzling Flare'"><span class="link-focus">Dazzling Flare</span></a> effect of <a class="complex" href="../solar/essence-arrow-attack.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Essence Arrow Attack'"><span class="link-focus">Essence Arrow Attack</span></a>. (See <strong>Exalted</strong>, pages 192 and 189 for descriptions of those Charms.)</p>

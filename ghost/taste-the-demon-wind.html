        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm is integral to the practice of taming savage wraiths, as it lets a ghost know where and in what number hungry ghosts can be found. It&rsquo;s also a handy Charm to have for any ghost who doesn&rsquo;t relish the idea of being caught unawares by packs of these dead predators. When the ghost actively, intentionally extends his senses to make himself aware of nearby hungry ghosts, his player rolls (Perception + Presence). If the roll succeeds, the ghost receives a sense that extends over a range determined by the number of successes, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 success: 100 yards</li>
<li>2 successes: 250 yards</li>
<li>3 successes: 500 yards</li>
<li>4 successes: one mile</li>
<li>5+ successes: five miles</li>
</ul>
<p>Within that range, the ghost can tell the number and location of all present hungry ghosts. This awareness manifests as a sound (like faint howling that no one else can hear), a smell (like rotting remains) or a sudden frisson of cold down the spine. Once the ghost is aware of the hungry ghosts, he remains aware of them for as long as they remain in the range determined by his successes. He does not gain any awareness of hungry ghosts who enter that range after the Charm is activated or who leave that range then return.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Ghosts who have no experience using this Arcanos must rely on comrades (or entrepreneurs) who know this Charm. With it, a ghost lays hands on a fellow wraith and gets a sense of the condition of one of that wraith&rsquo;s Fetters. This information is comparable to that granted by World-Bridging Meditation, though that Charm&rsquo;s meditative calm is not required. The ghost need only touch the wraith for whom he&rsquo;s checking in. He can even take this information without the other&rsquo;s consent as long as he can touch him. (Touching an unwilling target requires an unarmed Martial Arts attack.)</p>
<p>Once the ghost has touched a target, his player makes a (Wits + Awareness) roll. The difficulty is (5 - the Fetter&rsquo;s rating), with a minimum difficulty of 1. If the roll succeeds, the ghost gains insight equal to that granted by World-Bridging Meditation. Only the ghost who uses this Charm gains this insight. Also, the ghost can look in on a specific Fetter only if his wraith target is willing to have him do so. If the target is unwilling, the ghost can look in only on the Fetter with the highest rating, no matter how many of the target&rsquo;s Fetters the ghost knows about. The Storyteller chooses between Fetters of equal ratings.</p>

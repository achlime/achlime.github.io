        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Invoking his master&rsquo;s name and authority, the ghost extrudes icy chains from his palms that bind his foe&rsquo;s hands or feet. These chains—the links of which are shaped like the characters of the ghost&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s name—whip around the foe&rsquo;s limbs in an instant, cinch tight and seal themselves together at the ends.</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s target must be in close-combat range, and both parties must be corporeal at the time. The ghost must also decide when he activates the Charm whether he wants to bind the target&rsquo;s arms or legs. Activating the Charm is an attack that uses the ghost&rsquo;s (Dexterity + Bureaucracy) pool with a +2 Accuracy bonus. This attack can be dodged normally or parried with a stunt. If the attack succeeds, the target&rsquo;s arms are bound firmly at her sides or her legs are bound tightly together. A character whose arms are bound can move only her hands and fingers, while a character whose legs are bound can move, dash, swim or jump only one-fifth her normal distance.</p>
<p>The binding chains last for five ticks per success on the attack roll, not taking the target&rsquo;s defenses into account. (Dodging or parrying this attack is an all-or-nothing proposition.) Breaking the chains before the duration elapses is possible, though it is a feat of strength akin to snapping iron manacles. (See <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 127.) If the target breaks out of the chains, parries them successfully or dodges them when they come at her, the chains shatter into dust.</p>

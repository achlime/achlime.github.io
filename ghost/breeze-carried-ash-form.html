        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With this Charm, a ghost can fly through the air—i.e., he can take Move or Dash actions in all three dimensions. To activate the Charm, the player rolls (Dexterity + Athletics). Each success lets the character fly for six ticks. The only hitch is that the character must be incorporeal while he&rsquo;s flying. He must, therefore, be either in Creation and not manifest or in his natural environs and using the prerequisite Charm. (The Obvious keyword applies only to the latter circumstance.)</p>
<p>If the character has not landed by the time this Charm wears off, his momentum carries him for just a moment—long enough for a stunt, but not much else—then he falls. If the character is incorporeal, he plummets earthward toward either solid ground or the highest solid object between himself and it and crashes into it. If he hits solid ground from a great height, he suffers no damage but explodes into a poof of ectoplasmic dust that takes a single miscellaneous action to re-form into the shape of his body.</p>
<p>The trouble starts when the character is using the prerequisite Charm to allow himself to use this Charm to fly in a location where he is naturally solid. If this Charm&rsquo;s duration lapses while he&rsquo;s in flight, things could work out poorly. If he comes down before his use of Pyre Smoke Form runs out, he&rsquo;s got nothing to worry about. If he crashes after his Pyre Smoke Form Charm wears off, he takes damage normally based on how far he fell when Breeze-Carried Ash Form wore off.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Underworld is a bleak, gloomy place. The most common weather patterns alternate oily rain with ominous, gray fog with stiff winds that carry minute flecks of bone dust. Overhead, the sky is perpetually overcast, leaving it up to the Calendar of Setesh to divide day from night. Ghosts caught out in bad weather without a light source are effectively blind.</p>
<p>With this Charm, however, the ghost can see as well in the darkness of the Underworld as any of the three Full Moon entries on the Sample Visibility Conditions table on page 135 of <strong>Exalted</strong>, regardless of however much worse the visibility conditions actually are. The Charm functions just as well in Creation or a shadowland as it does in the Underworld. In any location, it functions only at night. The player rolls (Perception + Conviction) to activate the power, which remains active for a number of nights equal to successes on the roll.</p>

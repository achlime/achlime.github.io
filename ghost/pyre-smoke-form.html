        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In their natural environs, ghosts are just as materially solid as mortals are in their homes in the living world. With this Charm, however, a ghost can make herself incorporeal even in locations where she should naturally be solid (such as the Underworld). Activating the Charm requires a (Stamina + Temperance) roll. If it succeeds, the ghost remains incorporeal for six ticks per success. Yet although she is incorporeal, the character remains as visible as she normally would be in that location.</p>
<p>A ghost who is incorporeal can move through solid objects at will. That is, she won&rsquo;t fall through the floor of the second story of her home if she&rsquo;s just walking around up there, but she can plunge down through the floor for a quick getaway. She can dive through walls or doors or startled onlookers, or pull herself up through ceilings with all the grace her (Dexterity + Athletics) pool allows. The only surfaces that prove impenetrable to incorporeal ghosts are ones that are specifically warded against such shenanigans and the solid ground beneath their feet.</p>

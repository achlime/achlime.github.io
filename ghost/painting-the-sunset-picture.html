        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a haunter to hone his control over light and darkness into an ability to create detailed illusions. Such illusions are somewhat basic: they tend to periodically flicker or blur slightly, and they appear translucent in strong light. Nonetheless, they are three-dimensional images with a full color palette, and they can be as large or as detailed as the haunter desires.</p>
<p>Creating an illusion with this Charm requires a successful roll of (Wits + Craft [Pandemonium]). (See p. 116 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The difficulty of a basic illusion, such as an image of the haunter as a young man, is 1. A more complicated image, such as a re-creation of the scene where the haunter was murdered, is difficulty 2. A huge and richly detailed image, such as a faithful recreation of a Solar&rsquo;s palatial manse, is difficulty 3. At the end of the standard duration, the character can spend one Willpower point to maintain the illusion for an additional hour. He can do so again and again as each hour elapses. The ghost may also create as many individual illusions as he wishes, though doing so requires a separate activation of the Charm for each illusion. Finally, the haunter may create these illusions in the Underworld, shadowlands or Creation. If he&rsquo;s in Creation, he need not manifest physically to create an illusion. The Essence for each illusion is committed until the illusion dissipates.</p>

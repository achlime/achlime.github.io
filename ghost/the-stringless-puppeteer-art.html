            <p>Dutiful ghosts who practice this Arcanos are obligated by their Underworld lieges to remain vigilant for abuses of this power by their less scrupulous peers. This basic Charm grants them the ability to carry out that obligation. With it, a character can spot another ghost hidden inside someone else&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Upon activating the Charm, the character sees in his mind&rsquo;s eye a pale light emanating from within the body of every ghost in his line of sight. If a ghost is hiding inside another character, the ghost&rsquo;s face overlays the other character&rsquo;s face like a luminous mask. If the character sees a passenger ghost revealed thus, the player may make a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll at difficulty 2. If the roll succeeds, the character recognizes the ghost whose face he sees. Otherwise, all he can tell is that a ghost is hitching a ride.</p>
<p>The light the character with this Charm sees is not visible to anyone else. Therefore, ghosts revealed by it are not automatically aware that the character can see them.</p>

            <p>By paying close attention for a moment to a target in her line of sight—be that target ghost or mortal— a ghost can perceive that target&rsquo;s thoughts. As the character spends the requisite points, the player rolls (Manipulation + Awareness). The difficulty is equal to the target&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll succeeds, the ghost hears the target&rsquo;s surface thoughts as if the target were whispering them in her ear.</p>
<p>This mental eavesdropping lasts for one scene at the base activation cost. At the end of that scene, the ghost may extend the duration for another scene by spending another Willpower point. The ghost can maintain contact thus until either she runs out of Willpower or contact is otherwise broken. Death or injury to the target breaks contact, as does injury or any significant distraction to the ghost. (Spending Willpower for any other reason than maintaining this Charm&rsquo;s effects counts as a significant distraction.) Until one of those things happens, though, the ghost can listen in on the target&rsquo;s thoughts regardless of how far away and out of sight the target goes. Essence spent to power this effect is committed until the duration lapses.</p>
<p>Being able to hear someone&rsquo;s surface thoughts is not the same as being able to telepathically ransack a target&rsquo;s mind. If the ghost wants to learn some specific piece of information, she&rsquo;ll have to wait until the target thinks of it on his own. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to arrange circumstances that cause the subject of interest to occur to the target, though.</p>
<p>Most targets never even realize anyone else is listening in on them. If the target is Exalted or has more than two dots of Compassion, though, he gets the uneasy sensation that he&rsquo;s being watched.</p>

            <p>Activating this Charm is the same as for activating its prerequisite, calling for the same conditions and the same roll at the same difficulty. Likewise, it works on ghosts or mortals, and both Exalts and targets of sufficient Compassion have an unaccountable sense of being watched. Instead of allowing the ghost to listen in on the target&rsquo;s surface thoughts, however, this Charm lets the ghost sense what most of the target&rsquo;s own senses observe.</p>
<p>For the duration of this Charm, which can be extended as per Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline, the ghost can see, hear and even smell what the target does in addition to what he himself can. These phantom sensations are only vague and suggestive unless the ghost concentrates on them to the exclusion of his own surroundings. Paying full attention to both the target&rsquo;s senses and his own requires a successful reflexive Wits roll every action the ghost takes. Failing the roll means he loses details from his target&rsquo;s senses as he&rsquo;s forced to pay closer attention to his own environment. For this reason, many ghosts who use this Charm regularly to spy on their targets retreat to a safe location upon establishing contact—one either well hidden or protected by trusted guards.</p>

            <p>A ghostly smuggler, assassin or courier who uses this Charm makes a part of her body into the eponymous container. Drawing a fingernail along her corpus, she causes a hollow, nigh-undetectable chamber to open up. This empty space can be up to one cubic foot in area, and it can open into any part of the ghost&rsquo;s body. (The body part&rsquo;s size limits the size of the space, of course.) When the ghost puts an item to be hidden into this space and seals her corpus back over it, her flesh looks as whole and normal as ever. Storing objects in this ingenious hiding place imposes a +4 external penalty on any other character&rsquo;s attempts to locate concealed items on the ghost&rsquo;s person. An observer who uses Spirit-Catching Eye Technique as he searches the ghost&rsquo;s person will see the hidden object through the ghost&rsquo;s corpus.</p>
<p>Removing an object from its hiding spot can be easy or quite painful. At the end of the day, the empty compartment opens, and the item pops out as the Charm&rsquo;s duration expires. The ghost may spend three motes of Essence to eject the item herself before then. Other methods are less gentle. If an attacker knows where the item is hidden, he can use a stunt to target that area and attempt to either break the compartment open or break the item within. Breaking the compartment open requires inflicting at least three unsoaked levels of lethal damage with a specifically targeted attack. Likewise, either the ghost herself or someone who has the ghost in her power can cut the compartment open outside of combat, though doing so still inflicts three levels of unsoakable lethal damage. <a class="complex" href="broken-mold-strike.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Broken Mold Strike'"><span class="link-focus">Broken Mold Strike</span></a> (see p. 145) can cause the compartment to rupture with just a single level of damage, but the attack must still target the compartment intentionally.

            <p>This Charm is one step away from outright possession. With it, a ghost steps directly into a mortal&rsquo;s body and rides around therein, experiencing everything the mortal feels. Making entry requires first a touch and the expenditure of the activation cost. (The touch could require an unarmed Martial Arts attack if the prospective host actively resists.) As the ghost makes contact, the player rolls (Dexterity + Awareness), at a difficulty equal to the host&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll succeeds, the ghost melds with the target and becomes undetectable except by such Charms as Spirit-Catching Eye Technique. A target who is aware of the ghostly passenger can spend a Willpower point to try to expel the uninvited guest. Doing so requires the host&rsquo;s player to win a contested Willpower roll. If she succeeds, her character expels the ghost from her body. If she loses, the character must endure the ghost&rsquo;s presence for the duration of the Charm.</p>
<p>While the ghost shadows his host, he experiences all of the host&rsquo;s sensations as his own, including taste and the sense of touch. He can also share the space with other ghosts who use this Charm on the same host, so long as all the other ghosts are merely passive observers like him. If the host is injured, the ghost feels the damage and suffers an equal amount of bashing damage to his own corpus. If the host is killed, the shadowing ghost is ejected from the body automatically. Otherwise, the ghost remains for one hour. He may increase that duration to one day by spending an extra Willpower point, keeping the Essence committed until he leaves the mortal&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The intimacy of contact this Charm provides is sufficient for a ghost with the <a class="complex" href="fertile-soul-endowment.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Fertile Soul Endowment'"><span class="link-focus">Fertile Soul Endowment</span></a> Charm (see p. 135) to impregnate a mortal woman.</p>

            <p>Once a ghost enters a mortal or corpse body, this Charm bolsters that vessel and makes it more durable. Similar to the various Ox-Body Technique Charms, this one adds health levels, though only to the body the ghost is either shadowing or possessing outright. For each time the ghost has purchased this Charm, the body in which she is the passenger or puppeteer receives one extra -0 and -1 health level. These health levels apply only to the host body, and only while the ghost is within it using Mortal-Shadowing Technique or any possession Charm that descends from it. When the ghost departs the body, the extra health levels disappear, taking any damage marked in them away.</p>
<p>The ghost can buy this Charm as many times as she has dots of Compassion.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>If a ghost just wants to ride around in a mortal&rsquo;s body, feeling the sensations of life once more, he uses Mortal-Shadowing Technique. If that ghost wants to take total control of his mortal host, he uses this Charm instead. He must already be riding within the mortal through the prerequisite Charm, after which he can attempt to exert total control. Doing so calls for an expenditure of the listed Essence and Willpower, as well as a successful (Dexterity + Compassion) roll. The difficulty of that possession roll is equal to twice the host&rsquo;s Essence.</p>
<p>Success on the possession roll ejects any other ghostly passengers from the host&rsquo;s body and breaks any other ghosts&rsquo; connections granted by <a class="complex" href="#soul-whispering-empathy-discipline" title="canonical entry of charm 'Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline'"><span class="link-focus">Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline</span></a> or <a class="complex" href="#skin-riding-prana" title="canonical entry of charm 'Skin-Riding Prana'"><span class="link-focus">Skin-Riding Prana</span></a>. The host&rsquo;s consciousness is subsumed as well, leaving the host unaware of what her body is doing. The possessing ghost can exert either his own or his host&rsquo;s Strength, Dexterity, Charisma or Perception—whichever is higher. He relies on the host body&rsquo;s Stamina and Appearance and uses his own Manipulation, Intelligence and Wits. He can exert any of his own Abilities through the host&rsquo;s body as well. If the host has more dots than the ghost in an Ability that has to do with some physical activity or quality (such as Melee or Presence, respectively), the ghost can exert the host&rsquo;s higher traits. If the Ability is purely mental or social, though (such as Occult or Socialize), the ghost must use his own traits.</p>
<p>While the ghost possesses his host, he can use his Arcanoi as the Charms&rsquo; normal circumstances and conditions allow. Even transformation Charms such as <a class="complex" href="ghost-devil-form.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Ghost-Devil Form'"><span class="link-focus">Ghost-Devil Form</span></a> are allowed. (These physical changes lapse the moment the ghost leaves the host.) Costs for Arcanos Charms come from the possessing ghost&rsquo;s Essence pool. If the host is Exalted, the ghost has no access to the host&rsquo;s Essence pool. He can use any artifacts to which the Exalt was already attuned, however, and he benefits from any current magical effects that already apply to the Exalt&rsquo;s body. He cannot access the Exalt&rsquo;s Charms. If the Exalt has reflexive defensive Charms, however, the Exalt&rsquo;s player may still activate those Charms for his possessed character as circumstances necessitate. (Essence costs for those Charms come out of the possessed host&rsquo;s Essence pool.) The Exalt himself is not activating these Charms consciously. His instinct for self-preservation is simply taking over.</p>
<p>Possession granted by this Charm lasts for one hour. At the end of that hour, the ghost may extend the duration for another hour by spending a Willpower point. He can do so again at the end of each subsequent hour. The player must succeed at a new (Dexterity + Compassion) roll each time, though. If he doesn&rsquo;t, the ghost is ejected. The Essence that activates the Charm remains committed until the ghost leaves the body.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a ghost to possess a host as per <a class="complex" href="#puppeteers-masterful-hand" title="canonical entry of charm 'Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand'"><span class="link-focus">Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand</span></a>, only it works on human corpses rather than living beings. As the ghost spends the requisite Essence and Willpower, the player must succeed on a (Strength + Compassion) roll, difficulty 1. If the roll succeeds, the ghost becomes one with the corpse, animating it with her own Attributes and Abilities. Once she&rsquo;s in, the ghost may exert her Arcanoi through the body, but any attunements or reflexive Charms the previous owner of the body might have had in life are no longer available. The body has a mortal&rsquo;s seven health levels (-0/-1/-1/-2/-2/-4/Incapicated). The wounds that ended the body&rsquo;s former life do not contribute to these wound penalties. Damage inflicted on the possessed corpse makes the body harder to control, though, as does unchecked rot that occurs before possession.</p>
<p>In choosing a corpse to possess, the ghost must be aware of the effects of putrescence on a prospective vessel. In temperate climates, a corpse exposed to the elements lasts about seven weeks before it starts to come apart. A corpse in the frozen North or arid South might last months instead. A body left to rot somewhere more humid might last only two or three weeks. After that grace period, the body loses two permanent health levels every day as the flesh and sinew holding the limbs together comes undone. When it has no health levels left, it is no longer suitable for possession.</p>
<p>This Charm lasts for one day, which does not contribute to the aforementioned natural process of decay. When the day is up, the ghost may pay the activation cost again to extend the duration to one week. She can do so week by week for as long as she can afford the cost. Extending the duration in this way even once is very hard on the corpse, though. While it won&rsquo;t decay while she&rsquo;s still in possession of it, the natural process of decay catches up rapidly once the nemissary has been in possession of the body for more than a week. After that first week of possession, the body falls to pieces all at once when the ghost finally leaves it. Thereafter, no one else can use this Charm on that body. The ghost&rsquo;s Essence remains committed to this effect until the nemissary leaves the body.</p>

            <p>This Charm refines its prerequisite, making it easier to perform and less damaging on the possessed corpse. First, the possession requires no roll, and it lasts for as long as the ghost commits the Essence. Second, while the ghost uses this Charm to possess a corpse, the natural process of decay is halted. When the ghost finally leaves the body, decay resumes at its natural rate as if the intervening time of possession had not occurred. The decay rate does not catch up to the body as it does after one week under the effects of Nemissary&rsquo;s Ride.</p>
<p>Also, when the ghost activates this Charm, he may commit additional Essence to bolster the corpse&rsquo;s durability. For every three additional motes he commits when he activates this Charm, he adds one -2 health level to the corpse vessel. These additional health levels last as long as the possession, though they may be added only when the Charm is activated. The levels are also compatible with those provided by Intangible Guardian Presence.</p>

            <p>Rot is one of those unavoidable inconveniences nemissaries have to deal with on the job. With this Charm, however, they can repair damage caused by violence or natural decay. Every four motes of Essence the ghost spends reverses one day&rsquo;s worth of rot. As described under Nemissary&rsquo;s Ride, an exposed corpse degrades day by day after a grace period determined by the climate. Four motes spent to empower this Charm repairs damage caused by one day&rsquo;s post-grace-period decay. It can also roll back that grace-period countdown. With enough motes, a character can return a badly decayed corpse to the pristine condition it was in the moment after it died. To use this aspect of the Charm, the ghost must be possessing the corpse already, rebuilding it from within.</p>
<p>The second aspect of this Charm allows a ghost to heal damage the corpse sustains while she&rsquo;s in possession of it, though at the painful expense of her corpus. For the cost of only one mote, the ghost can dissolve one health level of her own body to repair one health level of damage to her corpse vessel. The damage can be bashing or lethal; the type she heals is the type she takes. The ghost cannot use this Charm to heal damage from aggravated sources, from fire or from magic that specifically ruins undead flesh—such as <a class="complex" href="../solar/blazing-solar-bolt.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Blazing Solar Bolt'"><span class="link-focus">Blazing Solar Bolt</span></a> or the <a class="complex" href="../solar/essence-arrow-attack.html#dazzling-flare" title="canonical entry of additional effect 'Dazzling Flare'"><span class="link-focus">Dazzling Flare</span></a> effect of <a class="complex" href="../solar/essence-arrow-attack.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Essence Arrow Attack'"><span class="link-focus">Essence Arrow Attack</span></a>.

            <p>This Charm refines its prerequisite such that the ghost can now possess the corpses of animals. The roll to possess the corpse is the same, as is the restriction that the body must still be reasonably intact. Animals larger than a full-grown wolf are too difficult for a ghost to control properly, as are those smaller than a rat.</p>
<p>While he&rsquo;s in control of an animal&rsquo;s corpse, the ghost uses the animal&rsquo;s Attributes and his own other traits. He can also use any natural capabilities of the animal&rsquo;s form, such as a bird&rsquo;s ability to fly or a shark&rsquo;s deadly grace in the water. The possession lasts for as long as the ghost commits the motes.</p>

            <p>Nemissaries use this Charm to animate large corpses that exceed the limitations of its prerequisites. With it, the nemissary can animate a humanoid corpse up to eight feet tall and weighing up to 400 pounds. He can also animate the corpse of a large natural animal or necromantic war machine, either of which can be as big as a mansion. Much larger corpses or necromantic corpse-constructs, such as the Mask of Winters&rsquo; horrible Juggernaut, are too large for any single nemissary to pilot. Animating such tremendous masses of necrotic flesh requires teams of nemissaries who all know this Charm working in concert.</p>

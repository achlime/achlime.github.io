        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm functions exactly like its prerequisite except for the cost and one key difference. Now, not only can the haunter move herself forward in time by separating herself from the Calendar of Setesh, but she can also move other ghosts forward with her as well.</p>
<p>To use this Charm, the haunter must spend six motes of Essence and one point of Willpower for herself and that same cost again for each additional ghost she wants to take with her. (She must skip ahead with the group, or the Charm fails.) The player then makes the same roll as for Staggered Dark Stars Movement, and successes determine how far ahead the group can skip. Every member of the group skips ahead the same amount of time. The ghost using this Charm must be touching everyone she wants to take with her who is unwilling to skip ahead. (Those who are willing need not be touching her, but they must be within 10 yards of her.)</p>
<p>As with Staggered Dark Stars Movement, this Charm functions only in the Underworld.</p>

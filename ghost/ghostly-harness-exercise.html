        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A ghost with Tame the Wicked Appetite can calm hungry ghosts, but she can&rsquo;t give them commands. A ghost who also knows Command the Hungry Devil can calm hungry ghosts and give them commands but can&rsquo;t train them and make them her own. Even if she makes the duration of Tame the Wicked Appetite permanent, all she winds up with are calm, intractable hungry ghosts who don&rsquo;t do what they&rsquo;re told. Only this Charm allows a ghost to truly make hungry ghosts willing and able to be trained.</p>
<p>To use this Charm, the ghost need only touch the head of a hungry ghost, which could require an unarmed Martial Arts attack if the ghost hasn&rsquo;t used one of the prerequisite Charms first to get the hungry ghost under control. When the Charm is activated, the hungry ghost forms an instant bond with its new master. The hungry ghost won&rsquo;t attack its master for any reason, even under supernatural compulsion, and it will respond to her training. That is, the hungry ghost can now be trained by the ghost who used this Charm on it, whereas it could not be trained at all by anyone before.</p>
<p>Training takes one month and lasts thereafter until the hungry ghost is destroyed. The ghost tamer can train as many hungry ghosts at a time in the same month as she can afford to affect with this Charm at the beginning. Once the hungry ghosts are trained, she can issue simple commands to them without using Command the Hungry Devil. The hungry ghosts remain unwilling to attack their master for any reason and will even come to her defense if they know she&rsquo;s in trouble. Unless the master trains them otherwise or keeps them tightly in check, they treat everyone else the way hungry ghosts normally would.</p>

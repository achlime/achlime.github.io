            <p>This Charm enables a ghost to discern information about the history of either a single piece of soulsteel or a soulsteel artifact—i.e., one for which soulsteel is the predominant magical material. He need only touch the metal a moment and close his eyes as his player rolls (Perception + Craft). The Craft Ability required is determined by the type of object in question.</p>
<p>If the roll succeeds, the player may ask the Storyteller one straightforward question per success regarding the object&rsquo;s past. These questions can include information about who has used the object, how the object was used and events that transpired around the object even when it was not in use. Items that are relics of things destroyed in Creation contain information regarding their existence in Creation as well.</p>
<p>The character receives all the answers to the player&rsquo;s questions in an instantaneous flash of information. People around him hear only a brief scream from the souls forged into the metal.</p>

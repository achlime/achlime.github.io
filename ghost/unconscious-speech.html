        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This neat little trick allows an incorporeal ghost in the living world to speak through a nearby living being. The ghost must &ldquo;touch&rdquo; the living being, and that being must be capable of speech. The character spends a mote of Essence as the player rolls (Dexterity + Performance). If the roll succeeds, the target says what the ghost wants him to say in up to as many words as successes garnered on the roll. At that point, the target&rsquo;s player is allowed a reflexive (Intelligence + Occult) roll. If the roll fails, the target remains unaware (and subsequently unwilling to believe) that he said anything. If the roll succeeds, he realizes what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>If a character realizes a ghost is trying to speak through him, he may spend a Willpower point to resist each subsequent use of this Charm against him from the same ghost. Or he could allow the ghost to speak through him. If he does so, the ghost&rsquo;s player need not roll and may communicate one full sentence per mote of Essence spent. The willing target can hear and understand the words spoken through his mouth, but he cannot speak while the ghost speaks through him.</p>

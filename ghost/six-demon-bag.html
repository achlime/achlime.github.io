        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A ghostly smuggler, assassin or courier who uses this Charm makes a part of her body into the eponymous container. Drawing a fingernail along her corpus, she causes a hollow, nigh-undetectable chamber to open up. This empty space can be up to one cubic foot in area, and it can open into any part of the ghost&rsquo;s body. (The body part&rsquo;s size limits the size of the space, of course.) When the ghost puts an item to be hidden into this space and seals her corpus back over it, her flesh looks as whole and normal as ever. Storing objects in this ingenious hiding place imposes a +4 external penalty on any other character&rsquo;s attempts to locate concealed items on the ghost&rsquo;s person. An observer who uses Spirit-Catching Eye Technique as he searches the ghost&rsquo;s person will see the hidden object through the ghost&rsquo;s corpus.</p>
<p>Removing an object from its hiding spot can be easy or quite painful. At the end of the day, the empty compartment opens, and the item pops out as the Charm&rsquo;s duration expires. The ghost may spend three motes of Essence to eject the item herself before then. Other methods are less gentle. If an attacker knows where the item is hidden, he can use a stunt to target that area and attempt to either break the compartment open or break the item within. Breaking the compartment open requires inflicting at least three unsoaked levels of lethal damage with a specifically targeted attack. Likewise, either the ghost herself or someone who has the ghost in her power can cut the compartment open outside of combat, though doing so still inflicts three levels of unsoakable lethal damage. <a class="complex" href="broken-mold-strike.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Broken Mold Strike'"><span class="link-focus">Broken Mold Strike</span></a> (see p. 145) can cause the compartment to rupture with just a single level of damage, but the attack must still target the compartment intentionally. Finally, if the ghost is willing but lacks the Essence or the time to remove the stored item naturally, she can allow another ghost to use <a class="complex" href="stolen-wax-discipline.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Stolen Wax Discipline'"><span class="link-focus">Stolen Wax Discipline</span></a> to painlessly pull back the flesh enclosing the compartment.</p>

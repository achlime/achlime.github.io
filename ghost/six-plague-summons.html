        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>While this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite creates only a single verminous specimen, Six Plague Summons calls forth a horde of them. Creatures summoned thus are ravenous and excitable, which makes them less able to follow complex or subtle orders. Of course, this power isn&rsquo;t exactly an expression of subtlety in the first place.</p>
<p>To activate the Charm, the haunter spends the required Willpower and motes as the player rolls (Wits + Craft [Pandemonium]). (See p. 116 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The ghost chooses the type of creature before the roll, which sets the difficulty. Creating mice or smaller creatures is difficulty 2. Creating larger vermin up to the size of rats is difficulty 3. After achieving the difficulty, the threshold successes determine how large the horde is, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 threshold successes: 10 creatures</li>
<li>1 threshold success: 50 creatures</li>
<li>2 threshold successes: 250 creatures</li>
<li>3 threshold successes: 1,250 creatures</li>
<li>4 threshold successes: 6,250 creatures</li>
<li>5+ threshold successes: So. Damn. Many.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with vermin created by Messenger of the Grave, these creatures can have their normal fangs, claws or stingers, but they carry no venom and can conceive no offspring. Unlike that Charm, they can carry out only one set of simple orders, such as &ldquo;Devour him!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Destroy these crops!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Swarm over everyone in this village!&rdquo; If they manage to carry out their orders completely before the duration of the Charm expires, they run wild, obeying the dictates of their ravenous hunger. At the end of the hour, they die off rapidly, leaving tiny carcasses strewn all over the place.</p>
<p>A haunter can use Six Plague Summons in the Underworld, a shadowland or Creation. He need not be physically manifested to create a horde in Creation; he need only be present.</p>

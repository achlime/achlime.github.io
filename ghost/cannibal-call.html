        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a ghost to steal from a victim not Essence or offerings, but that victim&rsquo;s very corpus. The attacker grapples her target and devours as much of his ghostly flesh as possible, replenishing her corpus at her victim&rsquo;s expense. For every two health levels of damage the attacker inflicts on her target with a bite, the attacker can heal one level of damage to her own corpus.</p>
<p>Unless the attacker has had her jaw and teeth reshaped to allow for a reasonable attack, biting a victim is not a very effective combat maneuver. A bite attack from a normally shaped human mouth has the following traits: Speed 6, Accuracy -2, Damage +0L, Defense –, Rate 1. Attacking with a bite also reduces the attacker&rsquo;s Dodge DV by two, rather than the standard -1 DV penalty for a normal Attack action.</p>
<p>An attacker must inflict at least two health levels of damage with a bite before she can activate this Charm. (She must inflict damage in multiples of two in order to recoup multiple health levels.) If she inflicts only one level of damage, or none at all, she need not activate the Charm, hence its reflexive nature.</p>

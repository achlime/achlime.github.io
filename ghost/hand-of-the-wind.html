        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a haunter to perform a physical action that affects the world while she is not physically manifested in it. (It works only in Creation or during the day in a shadowland.) Without manifesting, she goes through the motions of taking the action, spending three motes of Essence and one Willpower. Her player then makes a roll appropriate to the action. If the roll succeeds, the action occurs just as if the ghost were fully physically manifested, although the haunter remains invisible and intangible.</p>
<p>Hand of the Wind allows a ghost to affect the world with only one action, though that action can include a necessary preliminary effect. The haunter could, for example, snatch a dagger off the floor and throw it as one action. She could dip a quill pen in a handy pot of ink and write a simple sentence with it as a single action. She could step in front of a beloved living descendant who&rsquo;s under attack and punch the attacker in the face as a single action. Alternatively, she could snatch that descendant&rsquo;s weapon out of the mortal&rsquo;s hand and use it to parry a single attack directed at that mortal.</p>
<p>Actions the ghost takes with this Charm rely on the ghost&rsquo;s normal traits just as if she were corporeal and taking the action physically. They also provoke any reactive traits onlookers possess (such as DVs or reflexive Charms). Any action the haunter takes thus is considered unexpected, however, unless onlookers can somehow accurately sense her while she is intangible and invisible.</p>

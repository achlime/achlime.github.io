        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a ghost&rsquo;s living descendants burn certain goods (or paper replicas thereof) as an offering to the ghost&rsquo;s memory, black jade tokens bearing the ghost&rsquo;s name appear in the Underworld parallel to the location in the living world where the burnt offerings were made. These coins are known as &ldquo;hell money.&rdquo; The ghost whose name is on the hell money can draw Essence and Willpower from it. The amount is determined by the value of the sacrificed object. A ghost can still draw Essence (but not Willpower) from a hell money coin with someone else&rsquo;s name on it, but not as many motes as he could if the coin were addressed to him.</p>
<p>If a ghost knows this Charm, however, he can appropriate another ghost&rsquo;s burnt offerings as they appear. To do so, he need only be within five yards of the spot in the Underworld where the hell money will appear. While the offering burns in the living world, the ghost spends one Willpower point as his player rolls (Manipulation + Larceny). If the roll succeeds, the hell money appears with his name on it and is his to use to its full potential. The ghost for whom the hell money was originally intended is out of luck.</p>
<p>If more than one ghost wants to appropriate a burnt offering as it&rsquo;s being made, the hell money goes to whichever character&rsquo;s player achieved more successes on the activation roll. In the event of a tie, contesting players should roll again. Characters are not aware when their use of this power is contested, but that fact is usually self-evident to the loser. If a ghost with this Charm has reason to suspect that someone else is trying to appropriate his legitimate burnt offerings, he can use this power himself to try to make sure his hell money goes where it&rsquo;s supposed to.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a ghost to peer from his location in the Underworld into the corresponding location in Creation. (The realms exist in such perfect parallel that every place in the Underworld outside the inner slopes of the Abyss has a corresponding site in Creation.) This vision lasts only temporarily, and it works only one way. Someone in Creation whom the ghost in the Underworld can see with this Charm cannot see the ghost. By the same token, a ghost in Creation cannot use this Charm to look back into the Underworld. Also, the Charm works only when it&rsquo;s night in Creation.</p>
<p>Activating this Charm requires a successful (Perception + Occult) roll, after which it lasts for a single action. That is, the ghost can see into Creation for only those six ticks it takes for his DV to refresh after he activates the Charm. While the ghost looks into Creation, he cannot see what transpires around him in the Underworld, though his other senses still function normally there.</p>

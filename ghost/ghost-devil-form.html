        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Similar to Nine Terrors Visage, this Charm allows a ghost to design a transformation that he can later adopt instantaneously when circumstances call for it. Rather than just changing his face for the occasion, though, he can reshape his entire corpus, exceeding the limitations of Waxen Ghostly Flesh. His new form can sport natural weapons or armor. It can include extra sets of fully functional limbs. It can be up to twice the ghost&rsquo;s normal size (though it can&rsquo;t be much smaller than the ghost&rsquo;s original size), and it can be completely inhuman. Special effects such as those made possible by Nine Terrors Visage are also available here. Some of the traits for special features a ghost can create with this Charm include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional Eyes</strong> +2 on all visual-based Perception rolls</li>
<li><strong>Affecting Visage</strong> Per the Nine Terrors Visage Charm</li>
<li><strong>Armored Hide</strong> +2L/+2B, stackable with worn armor</li>
<li><strong>Claws</strong> Speed 5, Accuracy +1, Damage +3L, Defense +1, Rate 2</li>
<li><strong>Extra Arms</strong> Offsets multiple action penalty (see Exalted, p. 124) by one per extra set of limbs (to a maximum of three)</li>
<li><strong>Fanged Maw</strong> Speed 6, Accuracy +1, Damage +4L, Defense –, Rate 1</li>
<li><strong>Huge Size</strong> Two extra -2 health levels</li>
<li><strong>Prehensile Tail</strong> As per one set of extra arms</li>
<li><strong>Spikes</strong> Successful unarmed Martial Arts attacks on the ghost inflict 3L on the attacker</li>
<li><strong>Suckers</strong> +4 dice on clinch attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>A ghost must design his expression of Ghost- Devil Form before he can wear it. Designing the form requires a successful (Intelligence + Craft [Moliation]) roll. (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The base design time is one day, plus an additional day per special feature the final form will contain. Once the ghost has designed the form, reshaping himself in that image for the first time requires a successful (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll. The base difficulty of the roll is 3. Each special feature requires an additional (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll, difficulty 2. Once the ghost is satisfied with the form he&rsquo;s created, he spends the requisite 10 Essence to lock in that form. Thereafter, any time he wants to take on his new form, he may spend the same amount of Essence to activate the Charm and transform instantaneously. He remains in that new shape for one scene unless he then uses Steeling the Spirit to extend the duration.</p>
<p>A character may have as many different locked-in expressions of Ghost-Devil Form as he pleases, so long as he designs and physically fashions each one separately.</p>

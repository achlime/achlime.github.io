            <p>Ghosts who are incorporeal can move through solid objects with ease. Ghosts with this Charm, however, can physically become one with solid objects in the land of the living and hide within them. As the ghost lays his hand on the object, the player rolls (Manipulation + Craft). The Craft Ability he rolls depends on the type of object. He can hide inside only discrete, mundane objects that are not constructed of (and do not incorporate) any of the magical materials. Also, the object must be at least as large as a comb, and no larger than a yeddim&rsquo;s howdah. Once he is safely absorbed into the object, he remains there for a number of hours equal to the activation roll successes.</p>
<p>While he&rsquo;s within the object, the character cannot be detected by any mundane means, nor can he be harmed. He s vaguely aware of what goes on around the item, but specific information is beyond his reach. (He could detect people moving around in the room where he&rsquo;s hiding, and he could infer from their movements that they were looking for him, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell who they were unless they spoke and he recognized their voices.) If the item within which he&rsquo;s hiding is damaged, he suffers no damage himself. If damage resulting from fire, pulverization or magic affects the item, though, the character becomes aware of it as a faint sense of alarm. Should any of those three sources destroy the ghost&rsquo;s hiding place, the ghost is sent to Lethe.</p>
<p>A ghost using this Charm ends it prematurely if he exits the item in which he&rsquo;s hiding before the duration lapses. If he wants to hide in that item again (or move to a better one), he must activate the Charm again.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With this Charm, a ghost siphons off a portion of his Essence and seals it in some sort of inanimate container for later use. The best and most common containers are soulfire crystals (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Abyssals</strong>, p. 215) and Essence-containing gems (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Abyssals</strong>, p. 215), though other container designs are allowed. Vessels suitable for holding Essence are usually small and as delicate as glass, however, so it behooves one to handle them with care. Breaking a container causes an explosion that inflicts one die of raw (lethal) damage per mote stored on anyone within 10 feet.</p>
<p>To fill a suitable container, the ghost spends seven motes to power the effect and concentrates a number of his remaining motes to be stored in the palm of his hand. He then places the container there as his player rolls (Perception + Larceny) at difficulty 2. If he succeeds, the motes are absorbed into the container and stored there. If the ghost then spends a Willpower point to seal the container, the motes remain inside until someone takes them out. If he doesn&rsquo;t spend the Willpower, one mote leaks out of the container per day.</p>

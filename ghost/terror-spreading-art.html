            <p>Forcing back the heartless darkness of the Underworld, the haunter emanates a wan light from his body.

When up to seven ghosts shine at the same time, their light is as bright as midday in the trackless desert.</p>

            <p>As the ghost spends the Essence to activate this Charm, eerie blackness pours out of her mouth and nose and runs from her eyes like tears. This blackness is as empty and dark as the space between the stars, and it extends in a pulsing, quivering sphere 10 feet in radius around the ghost. Ghosts can see through this darkness clearly, but no actual light can move in or out of it. Anyone caught inside the radius of effect suffers a -2 external penalty to all rolls to take physical actions, and ranged attacks from one side of the boundary of darkness cannot be made against targets on the opposite side. Only time (i.e., a scene), choice (namely the ghost&rsquo;s) or the manifestation of a Solar&rsquo;s anima banner can dispel this cloud of darkness.</p>
<p>Normally, the bubble of darkness remains in place for the duration and affected characters can move out of it after a successful (Wits + Awareness) roll, which suffers the -2 penalty imposed by the darkness. If the haunter spends a Willpower point when she activates this Charm, though, she can move the cloud of darkness around as she desires as a miscellaneous action. She can move the center of the cloud as far as her natural Move distance per miscellaneous action.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a haunter to hone his control over light and darkness into an ability to create detailed illusions. Such illusions are somewhat basic: they tend to periodically flicker or blur slightly, and they appear translucent in strong light. Nonetheless, they are three-dimensional images with a full color palette, and they can be as large or as detailed as the haunter desires.</p>
<p>Creating an illusion with this Charm requires a successful roll of (Wits + Craft [Pandemonium]). (See p. 116 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The difficulty of a basic illusion, such as an image of the haunter as a young man, is 1. A more complicated image, such as a re-creation of the scene where the haunter was murdered, is difficulty 2. A huge and richly detailed image, such as a faithful recreation of a Solar&rsquo;s palatial manse, is difficulty 3. At the end of the standard duration, the character can spend one Willpower point to maintain the illusion for an additional hour. He can do so again and again as each hour elapses. The ghost may also create as many individual illusions as he wishes, though doing so requires a separate activation of the Charm for each illusion. Finally, the haunter may create these illusions in the Underworld, shadowlands or Creation. If he&rsquo;s in Creation, he need not manifest physically to create an illusion. The Essence for each illusion is committed until the illusion dissipates.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Like its prerequisite, this Charm allows a ghost to create a convincing illusion. The roll is the same, as is the range of difficulty based on the complexity of the image. Where Painting the Sunset Image creates only an immobile image, though, Midnight Canvas Unfurled creates an image capable of moving at the haunter&rsquo;s command. The haunter can either cause the image to slide across the landscape in three dimensions just as if she were lifting and repositioning a model, or she can cause it to appear to move under its own power. Illusions created with this Charm move as fast as their creators wish. The ghost can &ldquo;program&rdquo; the illusion at the moment of its creation to take a set of repetitive actions, or she can micromanage its movements with consecutive miscellaneous actions.</p>
<p>The illusion lasts for one scene, and the duration can be extended by spending one Willpower point per hour of extension. While the image exists, it normally affects only the sense of sight. For every five additional motes the haunter spends to activate the effect, however, she can cause the illusion to affect one additional sense. She could, for instance, make it talk or emanate a horrid stench. She could even grant it an illusory solidity and texture, though she could not cause it to inflict damage.</p>
<p>As with Painting the Sunset Canvas, the ghost can create illusions in the Underworld, a shadowland or Creation, and she need not be materialized in order to do so. The Essence required to create the illusion remains committed for as long as the illusion exists.</p>

            <p>An old standby of ghostly pranksters and specialists in spreading terror, this Charm allows a haunter to summon up liquids from nowhere. These liquids can be any harmless substance from water to blood to ink to dribbling phlegm. Powerfully deleterious substances such as acid, poison or flammable oil are not allowed, but less immediately harmful substances such as weak wine or slippery grease are fine.</p>
<p>When the ghost activates the power, he can summon up to 10 gallons per dot of Conviction he has. The liquid comes from any place in the ghost&rsquo;s line of sight, seemingly out of thin air, and its flow cannot be blocked. It lasts for one hour, drying, clotting, evaporating and conforming to the shape of its container just as is normal for the substance. When the hour is done, the substance disappears as if it were never there. Nonetheless, any damage it might have caused, such as ruining a sand sculpture or making a document illegible, remains.</p>

            <p>With a momentary exercise of will, the haunter creates vermin to carry out her will. She can create a scarab, rat, spider, snake or other creature of similar size, with all the basic traits and capabilities of a normal animal of the same type. The creature follows her mental commands to the best of its ability, and while it can&rsquo;t do anything a normal creature couldn&rsquo;t do, it is smart enough to understand and follow her orders. Vermin created thus can have (and use) fangs, claws or stingers like any other member of their species, but they carry no venom and are completely sterile.</p>
<p>Creating vermin with this Charm requires a successful (Wits + Craft [Pandemonium]) roll. (See p. 116 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) Creating an insect or other very small creature is difficulty 2. Creating a creature the size of a rat is difficulty 3 and is the limit of this Charm&rsquo;s capability. The animal lives for one hour, though the creator can extend this duration by additional hours by expending one additional Willpower point per hour. When the duration expires, the animal dies on the spot, leaving a perfectly natural corpse.</p>
<p>The ghost need not be physically manifested to create vermin in the lands of the living. She need only be present there. Essence used to create the vermin remains committed until the creature dies.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>While this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite creates only a single verminous specimen, Six Plague Summons calls forth a horde of them. Creatures summoned thus are ravenous and excitable, which makes them less able to follow complex or subtle orders. Of course, this power isn&rsquo;t exactly an expression of subtlety in the first place.</p>
<p>To activate the Charm, the haunter spends the required Willpower and motes as the player rolls (Wits + Craft [Pandemonium]). (See p. 116 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The ghost chooses the type of creature before the roll, which sets the difficulty. Creating mice or smaller creatures is difficulty 2. Creating larger vermin up to the size of rats is difficulty 3. After achieving the difficulty, the threshold successes determine how large the horde is, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 threshold successes: 10 creatures</li>
<li>1 threshold success: 50 creatures</li>
<li>2 threshold successes: 250 creatures</li>
<li>3 threshold successes: 1,250 creatures</li>
<li>4 threshold successes: 6,250 creatures</li>
<li>5+ threshold successes: So. Damn. Many.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with vermin created by Messenger of the Grave, these creatures can have their normal fangs, claws or stingers, but they carry no venom and can conceive no offspring. Unlike that Charm, they can carry out only one set of simple orders, such as &ldquo;Devour him!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Destroy these crops!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Swarm over everyone in this village!&rdquo; If they manage to carry out their orders completely before the duration of the Charm expires, they run wild, obeying the dictates of their ravenous hunger. At the end of the hour, they die off rapidly, leaving tiny carcasses strewn all over the place.</p>
<p>A haunter can use Six Plague Summons in the Underworld, a shadowland or Creation. He need not be physically manifested to create a horde in Creation; he need only be present.</p>

            <p>This Charm allows a haunter to perform a physical action that affects the world while she is not physically manifested in it. (It works only in Creation or during the day in a shadowland.) Without manifesting, she goes through the motions of taking the action, spending three motes of Essence and one Willpower. Her player then makes a roll appropriate to the action. If the roll succeeds, the action occurs just as if the ghost were fully physically manifested, although the haunter remains invisible and intangible.</p>
<p>Hand of the Wind allows a ghost to affect the world with only one action, though that action can include a necessary preliminary effect. The haunter could, for example, snatch a dagger off the floor and throw it as one action. She could dip a quill pen in a handy pot of ink and write a simple sentence with it as a single action. She could step in front of a beloved living descendant who&rsquo;s under attack and punch the attacker in the face as a single action. Alternatively, she could snatch that descendant&rsquo;s weapon out of the mortal&rsquo;s hand and use it to parry a single attack directed at that mortal.</p>
<p>Actions the ghost takes with this Charm rely on the ghost&rsquo;s normal traits just as if she were corporeal and taking the action physically. They also provoke any reactive traits onlookers possess (such as DVs or reflexive Charms). Any action the haunter takes thus is considered unexpected, however, unless onlookers can somehow accurately sense her while she is intangible and invisible.</p>

When a haunter uses the prerequisite Charm, he may spend five additional motes of Essence and one point of Willpower to activate this enhancement. In so doing, he doubles his Strength for purposes of affecting the physical world while he is incorporeal and invisible. This increase in power lasts for only the single action granted by Hand of the Wind, and he cannot activate it except when he&rsquo;s using Hand of the Wind. If he&rsquo;s attacking someone with Hand of the Wind and using this Charm&rsquo;s effect, the damage is automatically lethal, and the haunter cannot pull his punch or otherwise soften the blow in any way.</p>

            <p>When a haunter uses this Charm, she suddenly seems to flit back and forth from place to place faster than the eye can follow. To the ghost&rsquo;s perception, people around her seem to move sluggishly, like drowning men or dreamers trapped in hellish nightmares.</p>
<p>To use this Charm, the haunter spends the requisite motes and Willpower as her player makes a reflexive (Intelligence + Craft [Pandemonium]) roll. (See p. 116 for a full description of this new Craft Ability.) The character receives one extra action per success on the roll, up to a maximum limited by her Essence rating. This Charm is a normal extra action Charm per the description on page 182 of <strong>Exalted</strong>.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Flying Time Technique allows a haunter to compress indefinable instants of time in such a way that he moves faster than everyone else; this Charm allows him to manipulate the Calendar of Setesh such that he is completely separate from the flow of passing time. When the ghost activates the Charm, he feels momentarily lighter than air as the landscape around him blurs indescribably. An instant later, the sensation fades. The ghost remains in the same place where he activated the Charm, but much more time has passed than he experienced. To onlookers, the haunter seems to disappear, only to reappear in exactly the same spot much later in exactly the same condition he was in when he left.</p>
<p>Using this power requires a successful (Intelligence + Occult) roll. For every success the roll garners, the character may disappear for up to 30 minutes. He determines up front the entire amount of time he&rsquo;ll skip, and he has no knowledge of what happens in the intervening time. The ghost cannot use this power to move backward in time, only forward. Also, since this Charm relies on the ghost&rsquo;s connection to the Calendar of Setesh, he cannot use it anywhere but in the Underworld.</p>

            <p>This Charm functions exactly like its prerequisite except for the cost and one key difference. Now, not only can the haunter move herself forward in time by separating herself from the Calendar of Setesh, but she can also move other ghosts forward with her as well.</p>
<p>To use this Charm, the haunter must spend six motes of Essence and one point of Willpower for herself and that same cost again for each additional ghost she wants to take with her. (She must skip ahead with the group, or the Charm fails.) The player then makes the same roll as for Staggered Dark Stars Movement, and successes determine how far ahead the group can skip. Every member of the group skips ahead the same amount of time. The ghost using this Charm must be touching everyone she wants to take with her who is unwilling to skip ahead. (Those who are willing need not be touching her, but they must be within 10 yards of her.)</p>
<p>As with Staggered Dark Stars Movement, this Charm functions only in the Underworld.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As the haunter activates this horrid power, darkness flows from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth, coating his body in the impenetrable black that exists at the event horizon of the Abyss. This blackness completely obscures the character&rsquo;s features, though it clings to his body and trails faint streamers in its wake as the character moves.</p>
<p>For the rest of the scene, dozens of jet-black tendrils lash out from the character&rsquo;s tenebrous body in a five-yard radius to attack anyone nearby. The haunter&rsquo;s player rolls a single (Strength + Martial Arts) attack, against which every character in the radius must defend him- or herself. (These tendrils do not distinguish between friend and foe.) Each such attack roll counts as a (Speed 6, DV -1) action. A successful attack inflicts (Strength + 2) levels of lethal damage. If such an attack strikes a victim down to Incapacitated or below, several of the tendrils wrap around the fallen target in the next action and drag her toward the attacking ghost&rsquo;s black body. Doing so takes two independent miscellaneous actions (meaning the other tendrils continue to attack as normal). A character can attempt to pull a downed comrade free of the tendrils, engaging in a contested Strength roll with the haunter—all while dodging the other tendrils&rsquo; attacks, of course. If someone does not rescue a fallen character in the space of two miscellaneous actions, the fallen character is dragged into the attacking ghost&rsquo;s body as if that ghost&rsquo;s silhouette were a hole in space itself. If the victim is pulled through that hole in space, she is cast into the Abyss.</p>
<p>While a haunter uses this Charm, he&rsquo;s not entirely in control of himself. He becomes an extension of the death wish of the Neverborn who orbit the threshold of dissolution, wanting only to pull in and devour anything that resists the call of Oblivion. The most he can do of his own will is cover distance at his normal Move or Dash speeds. Otherwise, he cannot attack targets himself, nor can he defend himself. Although the tendrils&rsquo; attacks use his traits, they act only on the blind idiot volition of the Neverborn. Fortunately, although the ghost cannot dodge or parry attacks made against him, the tenebrous shell of Oblivion that surrounds him adds 6L/12B to his soak and a like amount of Hardness. Also, if a weapon is not made of one of the magical materials or is not otherwise supernaturally enhanced, it inflicts bashing damage against the character using this Charm. (Note, the weapon, not the attack, must be supernaturally enhanced.)</p>
<p>If a ghost is destroyed while using this Charm, he implodes and plummets into the Abyss.</p>

            <p>For the young ghost or neophyte ghost tamer, <a class="complex" href="taste-the-demon-wind.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Taste the Demon Wind'"><span class="link-focus">Taste the Demon Wind</span></a> is the best means of avoiding regrettable entanglements with savage hungry ghosts. If you know where the hungry ghosts are, you can avoid them from the start. Those who can&rsquo;t avoid drawing hungry ghosts&rsquo; attention, however, must rely on this Charm. With it, the wraith makes herself imperceptible to every hungry ghost in the vicinity.</p>
<p>To use the Charm, the ghost stands perfectly still and spends the required Essence as her player rolls (Perception + Presence), difficulty 2. On a success, hungry ghosts can no longer see, hear or smell the character. If she attacks one of them, however, that hungry ghost once more becomes aware of her presence.</p>
<p>Some ghosts who have been marked by Ferocious Predator Beacon can use this Charm to mitigate its effects for one scene. The affected ghost must have a higher Essence rating than the one who put the mark on her had at the time the mark was levied. Thereafter, any time the affected ghost&rsquo;s activation of this Charm exceeds the successes rolled to inflict the mark, the affected ghost hides the mark for one scene.</p>

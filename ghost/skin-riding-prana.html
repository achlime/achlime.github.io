            <p>Activating this Charm is the same as for activating its prerequisite, calling for the same conditions and the same roll at the same difficulty. Likewise, it works on ghosts or mortals, and both Exalts and targets of sufficient Compassion have an unaccountable sense of being watched. Instead of allowing the ghost to listen in on the target&rsquo;s surface thoughts, however, this Charm lets the ghost sense what most of the target&rsquo;s own senses observe.</p>
<p>For the duration of this Charm, which can be extended as per Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline, the ghost can see, hear and even smell what the target does in addition to what he himself can. These phantom sensations are only vague and suggestive unless the ghost concentrates on them to the exclusion of his own surroundings. Paying full attention to both the target&rsquo;s senses and his own requires a successful reflexive Wits roll every action the ghost takes. Failing the roll means he loses details from his target&rsquo;s senses as he&rsquo;s forced to pay closer attention to his own environment. For this reason, many ghosts who use this Charm regularly to spy on their targets retreat to a safe location upon establishing contact—one either well hidden or protected by trusted guards.</p>

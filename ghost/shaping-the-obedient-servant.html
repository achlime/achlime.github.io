        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Shaping the Obedient Servant allows a masquer to apply the range of changes made possible by Ghost-Devil Form to a willing ghost. Just as with Ghost-Devil Form, the ghost must first design the new form then apply it to the target. The rolls and difficulties for each are the same as for Ghost-Devil Form. Completing implementation of a new form costs nine motes of Essence and one Willpower point. Once the artist has designed a new form, he can apply it to as many other willing ghosts as he can afford to. The appropriate (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) rolls—see page 115 for a full description of Craft (Moliation)—are required anew for every subject (as is the activation cost), but so long as the design doesn&rsquo;t change, the design roll need be made only once.</p>
<p>Once a ghost implements the designed changes upon his subject, the new form lasts for one day. The subject cannot switch her form back unless she has Charms that allow her to reshape her corpus. Also, the imposed form is not considered to be &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; like a ghost&rsquo;s own personal use of Ghost-Devil Form would be. If the subject wishes to take that same form again after the duration elapses, she must have someone with this Charm reshape her. If the subject wants to use Ghost-Devil Form to re-create the shape, she must design the form herself from scratch. The subject may, however, extend the effects of the Charm as the artist completes the transformation. Doing so requires the expenditure of experience points, as well as a successful Willpower roll. One experience point extends the duration to one month. Two points makes the duration one year, and three points make the effects permanent.</p>
<p>The masquer commits the Essence to maintain his transformed creation unless the subject spends experience points to increase the duration of the effect.</p>

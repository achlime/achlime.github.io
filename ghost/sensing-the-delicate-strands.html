        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A ghost with the Extension of the Friendly Gaze Charm can learn valuable information about another ghost&rsquo;s Fetters. She does so only at that other ghost&rsquo;s sufferance, though. If she tries to raid an unwilling ghost for information, she gets information about only a single Fetter. Plus, she&rsquo;s got to get close enough to touch the ghost, which opens her up to the same risk if her target has Extension of the Friendly Gaze as well.</p>
<p>With this Charm, however, the ghost can learn much more about a target and with much less risk. To do so, the ghost looks at a target wraith and spends the activation cost as the player rolls (Perception + Occult), difficulty 3. If the roll succeeds, the ghost learns basic information about one of the target&rsquo;s Fetters, including that Fetter&rsquo;s nature, its appearance, its connection to the ghost, its distance from the target and the direction in which it lies. A successful roll also allows a new roll at the same difficulty. If that roll succeeds, the ghost gains information about another of her target&rsquo;s Fetters. Each successful roll gives new information (starting with the target&rsquo;s most important Fetter and working down from there) and allows an additional roll.</p>
<p>If a roll to use this Charm fails, the ghost cannot use Sensing the Delicate Strands against that same target again for one full day.</p>

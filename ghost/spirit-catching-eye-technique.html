        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Dutiful ghosts who practice this Arcanos are obligated by their Underworld lieges to remain vigilant for abuses of this power by their less scrupulous peers. This basic Charm grants them the ability to carry out that obligation. With it, a character can spot another ghost hidden inside someone else&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Upon activating the Charm, the character sees in his mind&rsquo;s eye a pale light emanating from within the body of every ghost in his line of sight. If a ghost is hiding inside another character, the ghost&rsquo;s face overlays the other character&rsquo;s face like a luminous mask. If the character sees a passenger ghost revealed thus, the player may make a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll at difficulty 2. If the roll succeeds, the character recognizes the ghost whose face he sees. Otherwise, all he can tell is that a ghost is hitching a ride.</p>
<p>The light the character with this Charm sees is not visible to anyone else. Therefore, ghosts revealed by it are not automatically aware that the character can see them.</p>

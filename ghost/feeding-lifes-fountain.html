        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When she is manifest and corporeal, a ghost can transfer some of her Essence to a living recipient, just as she uses the prerequisite Charm on fellow ghosts. The roll and limitations of this Charm are the same as they are for Blending the Streams of Essence, and the ghost much touch her intended recipient. The recipient must still be willing, as well.</p>
<p>If the recipient is an Essence channeler, he absorbs the motes into his pool as normal. If the recipient cannot channel Essence, the ghost&rsquo;s Essence augments the character&rsquo;s health for a number of days equal to (ghost&rsquo;s Essence x motes transferred). While this benefit lasts, the recipient gains one automatic success on all (Stamina + Resistance) rolls to resist illness or poisoning. This Charm also mitigates any fertility deficiency or reproductive difficulty short of literal sterility that would normally make conception difficult. (For rules on handling Essence exchange with characters with two Essence pools, see page 155.)</p>

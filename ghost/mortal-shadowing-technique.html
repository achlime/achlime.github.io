        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm is one step away from outright possession. With it, a ghost steps directly into a mortal&rsquo;s body and rides around therein, experiencing everything the mortal feels. Making entry requires first a touch and the expenditure of the activation cost. (The touch could require an unarmed Martial Arts attack if the prospective host actively resists.) As the ghost makes contact, the player rolls (Dexterity + Awareness), at a difficulty equal to the host&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll succeeds, the ghost melds with the target and becomes undetectable except by such Charms as Spirit-Catching Eye Technique. A target who is aware of the ghostly passenger can spend a Willpower point to try to expel the uninvited guest. Doing so requires the host&rsquo;s player to win a contested Willpower roll. If she succeeds, her character expels the ghost from her body. If she loses, the character must endure the ghost&rsquo;s presence for the duration of the Charm.</p>
<p>While the ghost shadows his host, he experiences all of the host&rsquo;s sensations as his own, including taste and the sense of touch. He can also share the space with other ghosts who use this Charm on the same host, so long as all the other ghosts are merely passive observers like him. If the host is injured, the ghost feels the damage and suffers an equal amount of bashing damage to his own corpus. If the host is killed, the shadowing ghost is ejected from the body automatically. Otherwise, the ghost remains for one hour. He may increase that duration to one day by spending an extra Willpower point, keeping the Essence committed until he leaves the mortal&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The intimacy of contact this Charm provides is sufficient for a ghost with the <a class="complex" href="fertile-soul-endowment.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Fertile Soul Endowment'"><span class="link-focus">Fertile Soul Endowment</span></a> Charm (see p. 135) to impregnate a mortal woman.</p>

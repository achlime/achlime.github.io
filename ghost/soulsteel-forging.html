        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>No matter how skilled a ghost with the prerequisite Charm is at transforming one soulsteel artifact into another, it&rsquo;s much harder to work raw soulsteel into fine artifacts. Under normal circumstances, only Exalted artificers have that capacity. With this Charm, however, the ghost internalizes the knack for working the metal, twisting the Essence and torturing the imprisoned souls into the proper shapes.</p>
<p>Forging items of soulsteel takes just as long as forging similar objects of normal materials, which can require ghosts to activate this Charm again and again until the project is finished. When the work is done, the item has all the standard abilities of its designed form, as well as the basic soulsteel bonuses. (See <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 387 and 390 for the bonuses soulsteel grants to close-combat and ranged weapons and to armor.) This Charm does not allow a ghost to imbue a new artifact with any other magical properties or powers as an Exalted artificer would be able to do.</p>

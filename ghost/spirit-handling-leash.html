        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a trainer of hungry ghosts to turn over control of hungry ghosts tamed with the prerequisite Charm to new masters. He must touch the hungry ghost&rsquo;s head and the new master&rsquo;s hand at the same time, as an evanescent leash of Essence extends briefly from one to the other. Thereafter, the new master commands the hungry ghost as if she were the one who had used Ghostly Harness Exercise on the hungry ghost in the first place.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the hungry ghost will not attack its new master for any reason, and it follows the new master&rsquo;s simple commands without the new master having to use Command the Hungry Devil. The hungry ghost will also refrain from attacking its former master unless its new master commands it to do so. It does not follow its former master&rsquo;s commands, however, unless the former master uses <a class="complex" href="command-the-hungry-devil.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Command the Hungry Devil'"><span class="link-focus">Command the Hungry Devil</span></a> or <a class="complex" href="dust-commands-litany.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Dust Commands Litany'"><span class="link-focus">Dust Commands Litany</span></a>. (Even then, the former master cannot command the hungry ghost to harm its new master.)</p>
<p>Only the current master of a hungry ghost can use this Charm to transfer ownership to a new master. The current master need not be the same person who used Ghostly Harness Exercise on the hungry ghost to train it, though. The ghost tamer who most recently used Ghostly Harness Exercise on the hungry ghost is considered to be the hungry ghost&rsquo;s former master for this Charm&rsquo;s purposes. Therefore, if one ghost tamer receives a hungry ghost from another trainer, it behooves him to retrain the hungry ghost himself (with the prerequisite Charm) before he transfers ownership to a new ghost.</p>

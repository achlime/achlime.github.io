        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>What a ghost with this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite can take away, so can he bestow. He must touch another ghostly character, which requires an unarmed Martial Arts attack if that character resists, and spend six motes of Essence as the player makes a Temperance roll. If successful, the ghost can then force a maximum number of his remaining motes equal to his Willpower through the connection. If the recipient is willing to accept them, she absorbs the transferred motes, adding them to her own pool. If the recipient is not willing to take them, the motes dissipate from the point of contact as a faint steam and are wasted. The same thing happens if the ghost attempts to transfer Essence to any nonghostly creature, regardless of how willing the recipient might be to take it.</p>
<p>A ghost cannot give more motes than the recipient&rsquo;s maximum, and he cannot leave himself with less than one mote.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By paying close attention for a moment to a target in her line of sight—be that target ghost or mortal— a ghost can perceive that target&rsquo;s thoughts. As the character spends the requisite points, the player rolls (Manipulation + Awareness). The difficulty is equal to the target&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll succeeds, the ghost hears the target&rsquo;s surface thoughts as if the target were whispering them in her ear.</p>
<p>This mental eavesdropping lasts for one scene at the base activation cost. At the end of that scene, the ghost may extend the duration for another scene by spending another Willpower point. The ghost can maintain contact thus until either she runs out of Willpower or contact is otherwise broken. Death or injury to the target breaks contact, as does injury or any significant distraction to the ghost. (Spending Willpower for any other reason than maintaining this Charm&rsquo;s effects counts as a significant distraction.) Until one of those things happens, though, the ghost can listen in on the target&rsquo;s thoughts regardless of how far away and out of sight the target goes. Essence spent to power this effect is committed until the duration lapses.</p>
<p>Being able to hear someone&rsquo;s surface thoughts is not the same as being able to telepathically ransack a target&rsquo;s mind. If the ghost wants to learn some specific piece of information, she&rsquo;ll have to wait until the target thinks of it on his own. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to arrange circumstances that cause the subject of interest to occur to the target, though.</p>
<p>Most targets never even realize anyone else is listening in on them. If the target is Exalted or has more than two dots of Compassion, though, he gets the uneasy sensation that he&rsquo;s being watched.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The blood of living creatures is powerful and almost intoxicating to the dead. With it, ghosts can be summoned, appeased or even bound. The dead rely on this Charm to locate this precious substance. With just a moment&rsquo;s concentration, a ghost with this Charm can detect the warm, sweet smell of blood spilled deliberately or even oozing from open wounds. The blood must have come from a living animal, a mortal or an Exalt, though the blood need not be fresh when the ghost smells it. The &ldquo;donor&rdquo; need not even be alive when the ghost smells the blood, so long as he or she was alive when the blood came out.</p>
<p>While the character uses this Charm, she can smell spilled animal blood at a range of one half mile per dot of Essence she has. She can smell a mortal or Exalt&rsquo;s blood at a range of one mile per dot of Essence. Strong winds, overpowering odors and a very large or very small amount of blood can all affect the range at which a character can detect the scent. No roll is required, though. The character automatically learns the direction of and distance to any site of spilled blood within her range. She can&rsquo;t discern such things as what type of creature shed the blood, how much blood has been shed or how long ago the bloodshed occurred.</p>

            <p>No longer locked in the prison of ever-degrading mortal flesh, the ghostly corpus experiences a remarkable degree of freedom post mortem. The most astounding expression of that freedom is the newfound malleability a ghost&rsquo;s body takes on, allowing it to be reshaped into a different form. It is with this popular Arcanos that such transformations are accomplished.</p>
<p>Only ghosts can be transformed with these Charms, though a ghost using the <a class="complex" href="puppeteers-masterful-hand.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand'"><span class="link-focus">Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand</span></a> Charm (see p. 148) can cause changes made by this Arcanos to temporarily transform the flesh of his possessed host.</p>

            <p>This Charm makes possible any cosmetic change the ghost can imagine. With it, the ghost can change his height, girth, tone, color and appearance in any way he sees fit. He is capable of any change on the spectrum of human variation and beyond. As the ghost spends the requisite Essence, he pushes and pulls on his features, molding them like clay. With concentration, he can change the color of his flesh in any way he pleases, even adding an iridescent sheen to its surface. The ghost can even add inhuman features or hide human characteristics.</p>
<p>Using this Charm requires a (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll. (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The difficulty varies based on the complexity of the change. Changing one&rsquo;s skin, hair or eye color is difficulty 1. Changing a facial feature is difficulty 2. Altering one&rsquo;s body shape is difficulty 3. Fashioning a nonhuman feature is difficulty 4. Any change imaginable is possible, though with certain restrictions. The primary consideration is that the ghost must reshape himself into a form with a roughly equivalent mass as his original form. Second, the ghost cannot grant himself natural weapons, natural armor or superhuman capabilities. The ghost can reshape his arms into wings, but that won&rsquo;t allow him to fly. He can change his narrow mouth into a gaping lamprey maw, but his bite attacks inflict no more damage than usual. Finally, the new form must remain roughly humanoid. The ghost cannot use this Charm to literally transform himself into a ghostly animal or a chair or what have you.</p>
<p>At the end of the scene, the ghost&rsquo;s reshaped corpus flows back into its original shape. The ghost can forestall this automatic transformation for one hour by spending a Willpower point. Every hour thereafter, the ghost may spend another Willpower point to forestall the change for a subsequent hour. The Essence he spent to affect the change remains committed until the duration lapses.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a little practice, a ghost develops a repertoire of effective façades for use in different situations. Some are terrifying, some are beautiful, and some are just disguises. The ghost need only spend a day designing and shaping a façade for later use. Designing a new visage requires a successful (Intelligence + Craft [Moliation]) roll. (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) Physically creating the designed visage requires a successful (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll, difficulty 2. When the character is satisfied with her new visage, she spends the requisite six motes of Essence to lock in that visage. Thereafter, she can assume that visage instantly by spending the Essence to activate this Charm. The chosen visage then remains in place for one hour. The ghost can extend the duration at the end of the hour by spending one Willpower point. She can do so again at the end of each subsequent hour. The Essence remains committed until the duration lapses.</p>
<p>Aside from an array of normal faces, the ghost can also create unique visages with special Emotion effects. Doing so increases the difficulty of the roll to physically create the façade by 2. Sample effects a ghost can generate include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fearsome Visage</strong>: Anyone who sees the ghost&rsquo;s face is overcome by terror. Affected characters&rsquo; players must make successful Valor rolls for their characters. If a Valor roll fails, the character flees the scene in abject terror. If the character is forced to fight the ghost wearing such a hideous visage in self-defense, his player suffers a -2 internal penalty to all rolls.</li>
<li><strong>Unsettling Physiognomy</strong>: The ghost&rsquo;s face is either so outright disgusting or so subtly wrong in proportion that people who look on her are deeply troubled by what they see. Unless an onlooker&rsquo;s player succeeds on a Willpower roll, the onlooker suffers a -1 internal penalty for the rest of the scene for any physical action. This penalty results from either nausea or overwhelming unease, depending on just what makes the ghost&rsquo;s face so unsettling.</li>
<li><strong>Vision of Loveliness</strong>: Seeing the ghost&rsquo;s wondrously beautiful face calls for a Temperance roll. If that roll fails, the ghost&rsquo;s beauty entrances the character. For as long as the ghost wears that façade, the character suffers a -2 penalty to his MDVs to resist doing as the ghost wants. He&rsquo;ll even take his own initiative to do what he thinks the ghost would like.</li>
</ul>
<p>A character attempts to resist the Emotion effect of a ghost&rsquo;s use of Nine Terrors Visage once, the first time he sees it in a scene. If he resists successfully, he is thereafter immune to that visage&rsquo;s Emotion effect. If he fails, his difficulty to resist that ghost&rsquo;s use of that visage increases by 1 the next time he sees it after that scene. If the character fails to resist the same visage from the same ghost four consecutive times, he can no longer even attempt to resist its Emotion effect until his Motivation changes or he undergoes some other significant psychological metamorphosis. If a character is Exalted, however, he resists the visage&rsquo;s special effect at the same base difficulty every time, regardless of how many times he might consecutively try and fail to do so.</p>

            <p>In combat, the ghost suffuses his corpus with Essence that makes it malleable and slightly fluid, allowing it to soak up a measure of an attack&rsquo;s kinetic energy harmlessly. In Step Eight of combat resolution (see Exalted, p. 149), the ghost activates this Charm and his player rolls (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]). (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) Every success on this roll adds to the character&rsquo;s appropriate soak total against that attack.</p>
<p>Attacking a ghost who&rsquo;s using this Charm is similar to attacking a wet clay effigy. Fists and weapons deform the ghost&rsquo;s corpus but don&rsquo;t significantly damage it. Arrows punch through it and come out the other side. The ghost still feels these injuries, but only abstractly. No matter how badly beaten out of shape the ghost&rsquo;s body is, limbs that suffer no actual damage thanks to this Charm still function as normal. The deformations caused by attacks that inflict no damage flow back into their original shape in two ticks per level of damage soaked.</p>

            <p>Many Charms of this Arcanos allow the ghost to make useful changes in her corpus, but those changes don&rsquo;t last very long unless the ghost spends massive amounts of Willpower. This Charm allows a ghost to extend the effectiveness of Charms that enable her to reshape herself.

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Similar to Nine Terrors Visage, this Charm allows a ghost to design a transformation that he can later adopt instantaneously when circumstances call for it. Rather than just changing his face for the occasion, though, he can reshape his entire corpus, exceeding the limitations of Waxen Ghostly Flesh. His new form can sport natural weapons or armor. It can include extra sets of fully functional limbs. It can be up to twice the ghost&rsquo;s normal size (though it can&rsquo;t be much smaller than the ghost&rsquo;s original size), and it can be completely inhuman. Special effects such as those made possible by Nine Terrors Visage are also available here. Some of the traits for special features a ghost can create with this Charm include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional Eyes</strong> +2 on all visual-based Perception rolls</li>
<li><strong>Affecting Visage</strong> Per the Nine Terrors Visage Charm</li>
<li><strong>Armored Hide</strong> +2L/+2B, stackable with worn armor</li>
<li><strong>Claws</strong> Speed 5, Accuracy +1, Damage +3L, Defense +1, Rate 2</li>
<li><strong>Extra Arms</strong> Offsets multiple action penalty (see Exalted, p. 124) by one per extra set of limbs (to a maximum of three)</li>
<li><strong>Fanged Maw</strong> Speed 6, Accuracy +1, Damage +4L, Defense –, Rate 1</li>
<li><strong>Huge Size</strong> Two extra -2 health levels</li>
<li><strong>Prehensile Tail</strong> As per one set of extra arms</li>
<li><strong>Spikes</strong> Successful unarmed Martial Arts attacks on the ghost inflict 3L on the attacker</li>
<li><strong>Suckers</strong> +4 dice on clinch attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>A ghost must design his expression of Ghost- Devil Form before he can wear it. Designing the form requires a successful (Intelligence + Craft [Moliation]) roll. (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) The base design time is one day, plus an additional day per special feature the final form will contain. Once the ghost has designed the form, reshaping himself in that image for the first time requires a successful (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll. The base difficulty of the roll is 3. Each special feature requires an additional (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll, difficulty 2. Once the ghost is satisfied with the form he&rsquo;s created, he spends the requisite 10 Essence to lock in that form. Thereafter, any time he wants to take on his new form, he may spend the same amount of Essence to activate the Charm and transform instantaneously. He remains in that new shape for one scene unless he then uses Steeling the Spirit to extend the duration.</p>
<p>A character may have as many different locked-in expressions of Ghost-Devil Form as he pleases, so long as he designs and physically fashions each one separately.</p>

            <p>This is the Charm many ghosts use to manifest physically in Creation. It&rsquo;s expensive, but it requires no roll. (In shadowlands, it doesn&rsquo;t even cost Willpower points.) To use it, the ghost simply spends the requisite points while she&rsquo;s present in Creation. The weight of her former living body settles on her corpus once more as she becomes both visible and solid. Keep in mind that the ghost becomes physical in whatever form her corpus is currently in. If other Charms in this Arcanos have been used on the ghost&rsquo;s body (even Ghost-Devil Form), the transformed body is the one that manifests.</p>
<p>The ghost can then interact physically with the living world, and physical attacks can damage her body. Her injuries bleed when she&rsquo;s wounded, though her blood vanishes when it is no longer in contact with her body. If inflicted damage &ldquo;kills&rdquo; her, her physical body collapses then dissipates into the Underworld. This physical shell lasts for one hour, and the character can extend the duration by an additional hour per additional Willpower she spends on the effect. (The Essence remains committed until the duration lapses.) She is still a ghost during that time, however, so she is still susceptible to effects that apply to ghosts.</p>

            <p>Shaping the Obedient Servant allows a masquer to apply the range of changes made possible by Ghost-Devil Form to a willing ghost. Just as with Ghost-Devil Form, the ghost must first design the new form then apply it to the target. The rolls and difficulties for each are the same as for Ghost-Devil Form. Completing implementation of a new form costs nine motes of Essence and one Willpower point. Once the artist has designed a new form, he can apply it to as many other willing ghosts as he can afford to. The appropriate (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) rolls—see page 115 for a full description of Craft (Moliation)—are required anew for every subject (as is the activation cost), but so long as the design doesn&rsquo;t change, the design roll need be made only once.</p>
<p>Once a ghost implements the designed changes upon his subject, the new form lasts for one day. The subject cannot switch her form back unless she has Charms that allow her to reshape her corpus. Also, the imposed form is not considered to be &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; like a ghost&rsquo;s own personal use of Ghost-Devil Form would be. If the subject wishes to take that same form again after the duration elapses, she must have someone with this Charm reshape her. If the subject wants to use Ghost-Devil Form to re-create the shape, she must design the form herself from scratch. The subject may, however, extend the effects of the Charm as the artist completes the transformation. Doing so requires the expenditure of experience points, as well as a successful Willpower roll. One experience point extends the duration to one month. Two points makes the duration one year, and three points make the effects permanent.</p>
<p>The masquer commits the Essence to maintain his transformed creation unless the subject spends experience points to increase the duration of the effect.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm refines its prerequisite, making it easier to perform and less damaging on the possessed corpse. First, the possession requires no roll, and it lasts for as long as the ghost commits the Essence. Second, while the ghost uses this Charm to possess a corpse, the natural process of decay is halted. When the ghost finally leaves the body, decay resumes at its natural rate as if the intervening time of possession had not occurred. The decay rate does not catch up to the body as it does after one week under the effects of Nemissary&rsquo;s Ride.</p>
<p>Also, when the ghost activates this Charm, he may commit additional Essence to bolster the corpse&rsquo;s durability. For every three additional motes he commits when he activates this Charm, he adds one -2 health level to the corpse vessel. These additional health levels last as long as the possession, though they may be added only when the Charm is activated. The levels are also compatible with those provided by Intangible Guardian Presence.</p>

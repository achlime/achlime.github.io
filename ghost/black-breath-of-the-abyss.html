        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As the ghost spends the Essence to activate this Charm, eerie blackness pours out of her mouth and nose and runs from her eyes like tears. This blackness is as empty and dark as the space between the stars, and it extends in a pulsing, quivering sphere 10 feet in radius around the ghost. Ghosts can see through this darkness clearly, but no actual light can move in or out of it. Anyone caught inside the radius of effect suffers a -2 external penalty to all rolls to take physical actions, and ranged attacks from one side of the boundary of darkness cannot be made against targets on the opposite side. Only time (i.e., a scene), choice (namely the ghost&rsquo;s) or the manifestation of a Solar&rsquo;s anima banner can dispel this cloud of darkness.</p>
<p>Normally, the bubble of darkness remains in place for the duration and affected characters can move out of it after a successful (Wits + Awareness) roll, which suffers the -2 penalty imposed by the darkness. If the haunter spends a Willpower point when she activates this Charm, though, she can move the cloud of darkness around as she desires as a miscellaneous action. She can move the center of the cloud as far as her natural Move distance per miscellaneous action.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is thanks to this Charm that the Ghost-Blooded exist, as it allows ghosts to impregnate living women. To use it, the ghost must be corporeal and must be in either Creation or a shadowland. During the scene in which the Charm is active, the ghost and the mortal woman need not actually copulate (though they certainly can), but they must share at least a long, passionate kiss. Either a male or female ghost may use this Charm, but the living partner must be female.</p>
<p>During the embrace, at a moment of the ghost&rsquo;s choosing, the ghost&rsquo;s player makes a reflexive (Temperance + Essence) roll against a difficulty equal to the living woman&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll fails, nothing happens. If the roll botches, the woman is stricken sterile unless her player succeeds on a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll, difficulty 2. (Exalted and other supernatural beings do not risk sterility.) If the activation roll succeeds, the woman conceives a Ghost-Blooded offspring. Regardless of the outcome, the scene is considered to be over after the attempt at conception.</p>
<p>The mother carries the child of a successful conception to term normally. The Essence spent activating this Charm remains committed until the child is born or the pregnancy otherwise ends. The ghost cannot willingly end this commitment. Even the ghost&rsquo;s destruction does not release the Essence.</p>
<p>One sinister implication of this Charm&rsquo;s effects is that only the ghost need be cognizant of its use. The living partner need be neither aware of it, nor willing to submit to it.</p>

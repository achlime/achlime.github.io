            <p>Similar to <a class="complex" href="two-world-vision.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Two-World Vision'"><span class="link-focus">Two-World Vision</span></a>, this Charm extends a ghost&rsquo;s sense from the land of the dead to the world of the living. Using this Charm, the ghost can hear what&rsquo;s going on in Creation (out to the limit of his normal hearing) from the spot parallel to his location in the Underworld. As with Two-World Vision, Whispers of the Living functions only during Creation&rsquo;s night and only in one direction. While the ghost listens in on Creation, he cannot hear what&rsquo;s going on around him in the Underworld.</p>
<p>Activating this Charm requires a successful (Perception + Occult) roll. It lasts for a number of minutes equal to the number of successes on the roll. Therefore, it behooves one who wants to be able to see and hear Creation from the Underworld to activate this Charm first, as this Charm lasts longer.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm grants yet more information than either Death-Avoiding Monitor or Veil-Piercing Binding. With it, a ghost chooses a Fetter (either one of his own or one that&rsquo;s currently subject to his use of Veil-Piercing Binding) and forges a strong mental connection to it. Having done so, he can thereafter sense its location and direction for the Charm&rsquo;s duration, even across the boundary between Creation and the Underworld.</p>
<p>Forging this link requires a successful (Perception + Awareness) roll. The difficulty is 1 if the Fetter belongs to him; 2 if it belongs to someone else. (He can target someone else&rsquo;s Fetter only if he&rsquo;s currently aware of that Fetter through the use of Veil-Piercing Binding, though.) If the roll succeeds, he can get a mental fix on the item&rsquo;s location and direction with just a moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>Mark of the Relentless Hunter lasts for one week or until the Fetter is destroyed. Spending one experience point at the time of activation extends that duration to one year if the Fetter is not destroyed before then. Spending two experience points makes the effect permanent. In that case, even the destruction or death of the Fetter might not break the connection. If the Fetter appears in the Underworld as a ghost or a relic of an object, the ghost who used the Charm can still track it. The Essence that empowers this Charm is committed if the ghost uses it for the standard oneweek duration. If the player spends experience points to extend the duration, however, that Essence is no longer committed.</p>

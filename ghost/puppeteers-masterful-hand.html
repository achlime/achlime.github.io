        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>If a ghost just wants to ride around in a mortal&rsquo;s body, feeling the sensations of life once more, he uses Mortal-Shadowing Technique. If that ghost wants to take total control of his mortal host, he uses this Charm instead. He must already be riding within the mortal through the prerequisite Charm, after which he can attempt to exert total control. Doing so calls for an expenditure of the listed Essence and Willpower, as well as a successful (Dexterity + Compassion) roll. The difficulty of that possession roll is equal to twice the host&rsquo;s Essence.</p>
<p>Success on the possession roll ejects any other ghostly passengers from the host&rsquo;s body and breaks any other ghosts&rsquo; connections granted by <a class="complex" href="soul-whispering-empathy-discipline.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline'"><span class="link-focus">Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline</span></a> or <a class="complex" href="skin-riding-prana.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Skin-Riding Prana'"><span class="link-focus">Skin-Riding Prana</span></a>. The host&rsquo;s consciousness is subsumed as well, leaving the host unaware of what her body is doing. The possessing ghost can exert either his own or his host&rsquo;s Strength, Dexterity, Charisma or Perception—whichever is higher. He relies on the host body&rsquo;s Stamina and Appearance and uses his own Manipulation, Intelligence and Wits. He can exert any of his own Abilities through the host&rsquo;s body as well. If the host has more dots than the ghost in an Ability that has to do with some physical activity or quality (such as Melee or Presence, respectively), the ghost can exert the host&rsquo;s higher traits. If the Ability is purely mental or social, though (such as Occult or Socialize), the ghost must use his own traits.</p>
<p>While the ghost possesses his host, he can use his Arcanoi as the Charms&rsquo; normal circumstances and conditions allow. Even transformation Charms such as <a class="complex" href="ghost-devil-form.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Ghost-Devil Form'"><span class="link-focus">Ghost-Devil Form</span></a> are allowed. (These physical changes lapse the moment the ghost leaves the host.) Costs for Arcanos Charms come from the possessing ghost&rsquo;s Essence pool. If the host is Exalted, the ghost has no access to the host&rsquo;s Essence pool. He can use any artifacts to which the Exalt was already attuned, however, and he benefits from any current magical effects that already apply to the Exalt&rsquo;s body. He cannot access the Exalt&rsquo;s Charms. If the Exalt has reflexive defensive Charms, however, the Exalt&rsquo;s player may still activate those Charms for his possessed character as circumstances necessitate. (Essence costs for those Charms come out of the possessed host&rsquo;s Essence pool.) The Exalt himself is not activating these Charms consciously. His instinct for self-preservation is simply taking over.</p>
<p>Possession granted by this Charm lasts for one hour. At the end of that hour, the ghost may extend the duration for another hour by spending a Willpower point. He can do so again at the end of each subsequent hour. The player must succeed at a new (Dexterity + Compassion) roll each time, though. If he doesn&rsquo;t, the ghost is ejected. The Essence that activates the Charm remains committed until the ghost leaves the body.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Flying Time Technique allows a haunter to compress indefinable instants of time in such a way that he moves faster than everyone else; this Charm allows him to manipulate the Calendar of Setesh such that he is completely separate from the flow of passing time. When the ghost activates the Charm, he feels momentarily lighter than air as the landscape around him blurs indescribably. An instant later, the sensation fades. The ghost remains in the same place where he activated the Charm, but much more time has passed than he experienced. To onlookers, the haunter seems to disappear, only to reappear in exactly the same spot much later in exactly the same condition he was in when he left.</p>
<p>Using this power requires a successful (Intelligence + Occult) roll. For every success the roll garners, the character may disappear for up to 30 minutes. He determines up front the entire amount of time he&rsquo;ll skip, and he has no knowledge of what happens in the intervening time. The ghost cannot use this power to move backward in time, only forward. Also, since this Charm relies on the ghost&rsquo;s connection to the Calendar of Setesh, he cannot use it anywhere but in the Underworld.</p>

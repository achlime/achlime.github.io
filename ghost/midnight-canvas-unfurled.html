        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Like its prerequisite, this Charm allows a ghost to create a convincing illusion. The roll is the same, as is the range of difficulty based on the complexity of the image. Where Painting the Sunset Image creates only an immobile image, though, Midnight Canvas Unfurled creates an image capable of moving at the haunter&rsquo;s command. The haunter can either cause the image to slide across the landscape in three dimensions just as if she were lifting and repositioning a model, or she can cause it to appear to move under its own power. Illusions created with this Charm move as fast as their creators wish. The ghost can &ldquo;program&rdquo; the illusion at the moment of its creation to take a set of repetitive actions, or she can micromanage its movements with consecutive miscellaneous actions.</p>
<p>The illusion lasts for one scene, and the duration can be extended by spending one Willpower point per hour of extension. While the image exists, it normally affects only the sense of sight. For every five additional motes the haunter spends to activate the effect, however, she can cause the illusion to affect one additional sense. She could, for instance, make it talk or emanate a horrid stench. She could even grant it an illusory solidity and texture, though she could not cause it to inflict damage.</p>
<p>As with Painting the Sunset Canvas, the ghost can create illusions in the Underworld, a shadowland or Creation, and she need not be materialized in order to do so. The Essence required to create the illusion remains committed for as long as the illusion exists.</p>

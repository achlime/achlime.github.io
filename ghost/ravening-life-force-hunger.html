        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The moment a ghost learns this Charm, all creatures with Essence have as much reason to fear him as his fellow ghosts did when he learned the prerequisite. The ghost can now use the effects of Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch on the living, on gods, on demons and on the Exalted. Doing so requires a touch, as well as the same (Manipulation + Larceny) roll at difficulty 2. The main difference is that the ghost must be manifest and corporeal, as must his target, in order to use this Charm.</p>
<p>If the target is capable of channeling Essence, each threshold success on the activation roll strips away two motes of Essence. These motes do not automatically transfer to the ghost, nor are they susceptible to absorption by Feeding the Lamprey&rsquo;s Appetite. If the target cannot channel Essence, this Charm disrupts her life force directly. The player of the affected character rolls (Stamina + Resistance) at difficulty 3. If the roll succeeds, the character survives but blows out a shuddering breath that steams bright white regardless of the temperature. If the roll fails, the character&rsquo;s time grows short. By sundown or sunrise (whichever comes first), chills and auditory hallucinations incapacitate her. If a character with at least three dots of Medicine does not successfully treat her, the victim will die within a number of days equal to her Stamina. Treatment involves an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll, difficulty 1, on behalf of a qualified character.</p>

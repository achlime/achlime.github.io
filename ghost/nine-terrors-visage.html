        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a little practice, a ghost develops a repertoire of effective façades for use in different situations. Some are terrifying, some are beautiful, and some are just disguises. The ghost need only spend a day designing and shaping a façade for later use. Designing a new visage requires a successful (Intelligence + Craft [Moliation]) roll. (See p. 115 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) Physically creating the designed visage requires a successful (Dexterity + Craft [Moliation]) roll, difficulty 2. When the character is satisfied with her new visage, she spends the requisite six motes of Essence to lock in that visage. Thereafter, she can assume that visage instantly by spending the Essence to activate this Charm. The chosen visage then remains in place for one hour. The ghost can extend the duration at the end of the hour by spending one Willpower point. She can do so again at the end of each subsequent hour. The Essence remains committed until the duration lapses.</p>
<p>Aside from an array of normal faces, the ghost can also create unique visages with special Emotion effects. Doing so increases the difficulty of the roll to physically create the façade by 2. Sample effects a ghost can generate include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fearsome Visage</strong>: Anyone who sees the ghost&rsquo;s face is overcome by terror. Affected characters&rsquo; players must make successful Valor rolls for their characters. If a Valor roll fails, the character flees the scene in abject terror. If the character is forced to fight the ghost wearing such a hideous visage in self-defense, his player suffers a -2 internal penalty to all rolls.</li>
<li><strong>Unsettling Physiognomy</strong>: The ghost&rsquo;s face is either so outright disgusting or so subtly wrong in proportion that people who look on her are deeply troubled by what they see. Unless an onlooker&rsquo;s player succeeds on a Willpower roll, the onlooker suffers a -1 internal penalty for the rest of the scene for any physical action. This penalty results from either nausea or overwhelming unease, depending on just what makes the ghost&rsquo;s face so unsettling.</li>
<li><strong>Vision of Loveliness</strong>: Seeing the ghost&rsquo;s wondrously beautiful face calls for a Temperance roll. If that roll fails, the ghost&rsquo;s beauty entrances the character. For as long as the ghost wears that façade, the character suffers a -2 penalty to his MDVs to resist doing as the ghost wants. He&rsquo;ll even take his own initiative to do what he thinks the ghost would like.</li>
</ul>
<p>A character attempts to resist the Emotion effect of a ghost&rsquo;s use of Nine Terrors Visage once, the first time he sees it in a scene. If he resists successfully, he is thereafter immune to that visage&rsquo;s Emotion effect. If he fails, his difficulty to resist that ghost&rsquo;s use of that visage increases by 1 the next time he sees it after that scene. If the character fails to resist the same visage from the same ghost four consecutive times, he can no longer even attempt to resist its Emotion effect until his Motivation changes or he undergoes some other significant psychological metamorphosis. If a character is Exalted, however, he resists the visage&rsquo;s special effect at the same base difficulty every time, regardless of how many times he might consecutively try and fail to do so.</p>

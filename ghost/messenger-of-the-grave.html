        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a momentary exercise of will, the haunter creates vermin to carry out her will. She can create a scarab, rat, spider, snake or other creature of similar size, with all the basic traits and capabilities of a normal animal of the same type. The creature follows her mental commands to the best of its ability, and while it can&rsquo;t do anything a normal creature couldn&rsquo;t do, it is smart enough to understand and follow her orders. Vermin created thus can have (and use) fangs, claws or stingers like any other member of their species, but they carry no venom and are completely sterile.</p>
<p>Creating vermin with this Charm requires a successful (Wits + Craft [Pandemonium]) roll. (See p. 116 for a full description of that new Craft Ability.) Creating an insect or other very small creature is difficulty 2. Creating a creature the size of a rat is difficulty 3 and is the limit of this Charm&rsquo;s capability. The animal lives for one hour, though the creator can extend this duration by additional hours by expending one additional Willpower point per hour. When the duration expires, the animal dies on the spot, leaving a perfectly natural corpse.</p>
<p>The ghost need not be physically manifested to create vermin in the lands of the living. She need only be present there. Essence used to create the vermin remains committed until the creature dies.</p>

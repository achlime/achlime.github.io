        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This is the Charm many ghosts use to manifest physically in Creation. It&rsquo;s expensive, but it requires no roll. (In shadowlands, it doesn&rsquo;t even cost Willpower points.) To use it, the ghost simply spends the requisite points while she&rsquo;s present in Creation. The weight of her former living body settles on her corpus once more as she becomes both visible and solid. Keep in mind that the ghost becomes physical in whatever form her corpus is currently in. If other Charms in this Arcanos have been used on the ghost&rsquo;s body (even Ghost-Devil Form), the transformed body is the one that manifests.</p>
<p>The ghost can then interact physically with the living world, and physical attacks can damage her body. Her injuries bleed when she&rsquo;s wounded, though her blood vanishes when it is no longer in contact with her body. If inflicted damage &ldquo;kills&rdquo; her, her physical body collapses then dissipates into the Underworld. This physical shell lasts for one hour, and the character can extend the duration by an additional hour per additional Willpower she spends on the effect. (The Essence remains committed until the duration lapses.) She is still a ghost during that time, however, so she is still susceptible to effects that apply to ghosts.</p>

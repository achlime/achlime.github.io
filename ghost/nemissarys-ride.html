        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows a ghost to possess a host as per <a class="complex" href="puppeteers-masterful-hand.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand'"><span class="link-focus">Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand</span></a>, only it works on human corpses rather than living beings. As the ghost spends the requisite Essence and Willpower, the player must succeed on a (Strength + Compassion) roll, difficulty 1. If the roll succeeds, the ghost becomes one with the corpse, animating it with her own Attributes and Abilities. Once she&rsquo;s in, the ghost may exert her Arcanoi through the body, but any attunements or reflexive Charms the previous owner of the body might have had in life are no longer available. The body has a mortal&rsquo;s seven health levels (-0/-1/-1/-2/-2/-4/Incapicated). The wounds that ended the body&rsquo;s former life do not contribute to these wound penalties. Damage inflicted on the possessed corpse makes the body harder to control, though, as does unchecked rot that occurs before possession.</p>
<p>In choosing a corpse to possess, the ghost must be aware of the effects of putrescence on a prospective vessel. In temperate climates, a corpse exposed to the elements lasts about seven weeks before it starts to come apart. A corpse in the frozen North or arid South might last months instead. A body left to rot somewhere more humid might last only two or three weeks. After that grace period, the body loses two permanent health levels every day as the flesh and sinew holding the limbs together comes undone. When it has no health levels left, it is no longer suitable for possession.</p>
<p>This Charm lasts for one day, which does not contribute to the aforementioned natural process of decay. When the day is up, the ghost may pay the activation cost again to extend the duration to one week. She can do so week by week for as long as she can afford the cost. Extending the duration in this way even once is very hard on the corpse, though. While it won&rsquo;t decay while she&rsquo;s still in possession of it, the natural process of decay catches up rapidly once the nemissary has been in possession of the body for more than a week. After that first week of possession, the body falls to pieces all at once when the ghost finally leaves it. Thereafter, no one else can use this Charm on that body. The ghost&rsquo;s Essence remains committed to this effect until the nemissary leaves the body.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Once a ghost successfully uses Extension of the Friendly Gaze on another ghost, she may use this Charm on her immediately following action. Doing so grants her target of Extension of the Friendly Gaze a continual background awareness of the Fetter on which she just checked. This awareness is identical to the awareness granted by the Death-Avoiding Monitor Charm. Establishing this link requires a successful (Perception + Temperance) roll, difficulty 2. Thereafter, the target need only concentrate a moment to become aware of the Fetter&rsquo;s current condition as if the target had used Death-Avoiding Monitor on his own Fetter.</p>
<p>If the ghost who used this Charm so desires, she can grant herself the same awareness of a target&rsquo;s Fetter as she grants the target. Doing so requires an extra threshold success on the activation roll. Thereafter, during the duration of the effect, the ghost may look in on her fellow wraith&rsquo;s Fetter at any time by spending one mote of Essence.</p>
<p>This Charm&rsquo;s effects last for one week. The ghost can extend the effect to one year by spending one experience point at the time of activation. Spending two points makes the effect permanent. The Essence that empowers this Charm is committed if the ghost uses it for the standard one-week duration. If the player spends experience points to extend the duration, however, that Essence is no longer committed.</p>

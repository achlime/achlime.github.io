            <p>Spirits use blessings to aid their allies in battle, but more importantly, blessings often ensure the loyalty and effective service of a spirit&rsquo;s messengers, followers and lieutenants.</p>
<p>All recipients of a blessing must be willing. If the target (or targets) possess Essence 1, the motes the spirit spends to power the blessing Charm are uncommitted, and the spirit may do so from any distance (unless the spirit possesses a version of the Charm that must be delivered through physical contact or presence), provided she has an arcane link to the target (most commonly prayer; see pp. 168-169). If a target possesses Essence 2+, the spirit must be in his presence in some fashion and commit the motes to bless the target.</p>
<p>Some spirits can issue blessings that deactivate under certain conditions. Blessings from similar sources and with similar purposes don&rsquo;t stack their effects.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit adjusts the target&rsquo;s core Essence balance in favor of one element, Celestial Incarnae or Primordial. The effects are somewhat positive—but ultimately, any such imbalance is unhealthy, even when administered benevolently. As a result, this power can be used as a curse against unwilling targets, in which case it follows <a class="complex" href="curses.html" title="canonical entry of topic bundle 'Curses'"><span class="link-focus">Curses</span></a> guidelines (see p. 165).</p>
<p>Potential effects include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating the normal penalty for having 0 dots in any Ability associated with the element in question</li>
<li>Removing the mote surcharge from certain elementally aspected Charms</li>
<li>Removing the penalty associated with working one magical material</li>
<li>Fooling certain powers that can ascertain elemental associations</li>
<li>Variously altering Charm effects that have the Holy or elemental descriptor</li>
<li>Increasing Essence respiration in appropriately aspected areas by one mote per hour, which might thereby allow respiration in places where it wasn&rsquo;t previously possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Stranger and more powerful effects are possible, especially when esoteric creatures or other gods are infused. Most gods possess a version of (Element) Dragon&rsquo;s Embrace capable of producing only one of the above effects; some can use two or three.</p>
<p>For every positive effect granted by this Charm, the target suffers an emotional or mental imbalance of some sort. These take the form of Illusion or Emotion effects that occasionally force the target&rsquo;s player to spend one Willpower lest they dramatically manifest. They might influence a character into acting strangely—perhaps out of uncontrollable, fiery rage—or based on incorrect beliefs—perhaps due to wispy, airy hallucinations.</p>
<p>Some spirits, especially elementals and servants of the Celestial Incarnae, seem to spring into being with the effects of this Charm as a permanent part of their existence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The target gains an immense boon. This Charm can grant dots of traits such as Attributes, Abilities, Willpower, Virtues—even Essence. Endowment can grant the use of Charms. It can even grant physical or metaphysical alterations. Almost any sort of boon is possible, though generally the spirit possess that quality itself. The minimum Essence of this Charm is determined by the granted power, and the mote cost is equal to triple the final minimum Essence. When bestowing trait dots, increase the minimum Essence by two for every dot gifted after the first. Blessing a target beyond her normal potential—for instance, beyond five Attribute dots or one Essence for a mortal—increases the minimum Essence by two more.</p>
<p>If an Endowment bestows the use of a Charm, then use the minimum Essence of the bestowed Charm (if higher than that of Endowment). If it bestows the effects of a Charm, on the other hand, the duration of the Endowment is limited to the duration of the gifted Charm, and the spirit must pay the cost of the Endowment plus the cost of the bestowed Charm.</p>
<p>Endowments that grant physical benefits other than Charms or trait dots can be modeled with the &ldquo;Touch of the Wyld&rdquo; section on pages 288-290 of <strong>Exalted</strong>. (Even more such benefits may be found on pp. 144-148 of <strong>The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II—The Wyld</strong> and on pp. 206-209 of <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Lunars</strong>.) Endowment can add positive qualities or remove negative ones. If the Endowment is about as useful as an affliction or heals a problem as bad as a debility, add one to this Charm&rsquo;s minimum Essence. Blights and deformities raise minimum Essence by two; abominations by three.</p>
<p>Most spirits have one unique version of this Charm that bestows a combination of effects. If a spirit&rsquo;s Endowment grants dots of various traits, physical changes and Charm effects, use the highest minimum Essence of all of the effects and add one for every additional effect.</p>

            <p>The target is blessed by one of the spirit&rsquo;s Excellencies, which can add up to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence in dice. These dice always count toward the maximum number of dice the target can add to her pools through Charms.</p>
<p>The recipient may be allowed to instinctively understand how to draw upon it when she needs it, or the spirit might set conditions in which the Excellency activates (for instance, &ldquo;When fighting an enemy of my faith&rdquo;), or the spirit may choose when to use the Excellency itself to assist the recipient.</p>
<p>A target of this Charm with her own mote pools may fuel the Excellency&rsquo;s activation with her own motes. Otherwise, the spirit must allow her to draw from its own pool.</p>

She&rsquo;s much less likely to be attacked by the god&rsquo;s inferiors, and may spend one Willpower to call upon the Mandate of Subordination (see p. 169) and give an order that such an inferior must follow, as long as it&rsquo;s seen the signet on the target.</p>

            <p>This Charm can be a gift of motes, Willpower points or some other temporary spiritual renewal. If motes are transferred, then they&rsquo;re given on a one-for-one basis. Temporary Willpower costs three motes of Essence and one of the spirit&rsquo;s own temporary Willpower per point. More potent examples include nourishment or Virtue channels, which cost more than motes or Willpower. Spirits cannot spend more motes per use of this Charm than their (Essence x 3).</p>
<p>If the spirit consents, the target may receive this boon permanently; the spirit may also withdraw it at any time before the Charm ends. These blessings are usually much more specific and interesting than motes or Willpower. Recipients have been known to use the divine boon as a guide to awaken their own Essence, uncover esoteric truths buried deep within themselves, relive memories lost to the Ages and so on.</p>

<strong>Costs:</strong> 3m+, 1wp, <strong>Mins:</strong> <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, <strong>Type:</strong> Simple<br>
            <strong>Keywords:</strong> <a class="unobtrusive" href="../keywords.html#obvious">Obvious</a>, <a class="unobtrusive" href="../keywords.html#shaping">Shaping</a>, <a class="unobtrusive" href="../keywords.html#touch">Touch</a><br>

        </div>


        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Touch of Grace allows a spirit to pour its own ephemeral substance into cracks and wounds, mending them. Spirits might use the Charm to fix broken parts of their domain, to perform miraculous healings or perhaps to relieve themselves of minor damage.</p>
<p>For every three motes a spirit spends powering this Charm, the target removes one health level of damage (one mote per level, if the damage is bashing). Recipients may even remain healed after the duration of the Charm has expired, if the spirit wishes.</p>
<p>This considerable power has weaknesses. Wounds that are too deep cannot be healed: a spirit may spend no more motes per usage than its ([lower of Essence or Compassion] x 3), and if the spirit can&rsquo;t heal the target completely with a single use of Touch of Grace, the Charm has no effect. Also, damage of a supernatural nature, including all aggravated damage, can be healed only until the spirit uncommits the motes fueling the Charm—whereupon it returns.</p>
<p>Touch of Grace can cure Crippling, Poison or Sickness effects. To determine the mote cost, each counts as a number of lethal health levels equal to a Poison&rsquo;s Toxicity, a Sickness&rsquo;s Untreated Morbidity or a Crippling effect&rsquo;s relative seriousness, as decided by the Storyteller on a scale of 1 to 5. Unusually powerful effects may count as up to 10. Supernatural effects, such as magical wounds, also return when the duration ends.</p>
<p>Touch of Grace has no effect on artifacts or on things that are in stark opposition to the spirit&rsquo;s nature. For example, undead or demons usually cannot benefit from this Charm if it&rsquo;s used by a god of the Celestial Hierarchy, and a water elemental may not understand how to heal a creature made of fire.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit adjusts the target&rsquo;s core Essence balance in favor of one element, Celestial Incarnae or Primordial. The effects are somewhat positive—but ultimately, any such imbalance is unhealthy, even when administered benevolently. As a result, this power can be used as a curse against unwilling targets, in which case it follows <a class="complex" href="curses.html" title="canonical entry of topic bundle 'Curses'"><span class="link-focus">Curses</span></a> guidelines (see p. 165).</p>
<p>Potential effects include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating the normal penalty for having 0 dots in any Ability associated with the element in question</li>
<li>Removing the mote surcharge from certain elementally aspected Charms</li>
<li>Removing the penalty associated with working one magical material</li>
<li>Fooling certain powers that can ascertain elemental associations</li>
<li>Variously altering Charm effects that have the Holy or elemental descriptor</li>
<li>Increasing Essence respiration in appropriately aspected areas by one mote per hour, which might thereby allow respiration in places where it wasn&rsquo;t previously possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Stranger and more powerful effects are possible, especially when esoteric creatures or other gods are infused. Most gods possess a version of (Element) Dragon&rsquo;s Embrace capable of producing only one of the above effects; some can use two or three.</p>
<p>For every positive effect granted by this Charm, the target suffers an emotional or mental imbalance of some sort. These take the form of Illusion or Emotion effects that occasionally force the target&rsquo;s player to spend one Willpower lest they dramatically manifest. They might influence a character into acting strangely—perhaps out of uncontrollable, fiery rage—or based on incorrect beliefs—perhaps due to wispy, airy hallucinations.</p>
<p>Some spirits, especially elementals and servants of the Celestial Incarnae, seem to spring into being with the effects of this Charm as a permanent part of their existence.</p>

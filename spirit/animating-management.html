        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit possesses an object, requiring Essence and Temperance scores greater than an artifact&rsquo;s level if the target is an artifact. (Possessed artifacts that require attunement to function still require that attunement.) The spirit may then activate the object and use it as its designer intended. The spirit may use its own traits to accomplish things from within the object, but Attribute scores are limited to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence, and Abilities are limited to its Temperance. For instance, a spirit inhabiting a daiklave may swing it with ([lower of Dexterity or Essence] + [lower of Melee or Temperance]); the sword&rsquo;s bonuses would still count. A spirit in an Essence cannon could fire the cannon. Spirits possessing armor could walk the empty suits around. For the purposes of this Charm, &ldquo;an object&rdquo; needs to be a self-contained unit, but it may consist of multiple components, such as a suit of armor or a magitech artifact.</p>
<p>By spending another 10 motes and one Willpower point, a spirit of Essence 3+ can imbue its possessed object with a certain level of flexibility. This might move the object in weird ways or allow it to be used it in a way it wasn&rsquo;t designed to be used.</p>
<p>Spirits possessing objects can be recognized by anyone who can see the immaterial. Another spirit with domain over the inhabited object and higher Essence can eject the possessing spirit just by wishing to, but this takes a scene.</p>

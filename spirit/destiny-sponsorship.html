        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit has reached an accord with destiny that shields the spirit from most casual troubles. This sacred contract imposes an external penalty equal to the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Valor) to most rolls which could opposed by the spirit&rsquo;s Resistance, Integrity, or Dodge, even if the spirit is unaware of the effect. The spirit also gains soak equal to its (Essence + Valor) against most lethal or bashing damage. The only things that bypass this power are Essence-enhanced effects intended to affect the spirit specifically and the machinations of character with a Destiny (see <strong>Scroll of the Monk</strong>, pp. 151-152) greater than the spirit&rsquo;s ([Essence + Valor] / 2). This Charm has no effect during Calibration.</p>
<p>The Destiny Sponsorship contract involves a number of taboos and restrictions equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence, which she must always observe. Any spirit who fails to observe these taboos loses the effects of this Charm and cannot reactivate it until Calibration.</p>
<p>Any spirit requested to state the conditions of its Destiny Sponsorship in Old Realm must immediately and honestly do so, lest the spirit lose the benefits.</p>

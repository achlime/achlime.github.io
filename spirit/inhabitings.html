            <p>Immaterial spirits can go places that material creatures can&rsquo;t, such as into people or objects.</p>
<p>Inhabitings require a material host, such as a person, object or natural feature. People must be living. Objects must be at least whole enough to function. Natural features must be at least man-sized, but cannot usually exceed the size of a large tree. If a spirit&rsquo;s host becomes unusable—for instance, an elemental dematerializes, a person dies or an object is broken—the spirit is ejected over at least five ticks, during which time the spirit&rsquo;s Inactive. Ejection deals 10 dice of aggravated damage that can only be soaked internally, and probably not at all.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, only one spirit may inhabit any potential target, by immaterially touching it and entering the same space that it occupies. Living creatures&rsquo; souls don&rsquo;t count as possessing spirits for this purpose. Because most Essence 1 spirits can use the Charm Landscape Hide, it can be difficult for a spirit to find a place to inhabit that isn&rsquo;t the spirit&rsquo;s own domain.</p>
<p>Inhabiting spirits are counted as immaterial for the purpose of determining what can affect them. They cannot move independently of their host without ending the Inhabiting. The external soak of the host does not stack with the external soak of the inhabiting spirit.</p>
<p>Inhabitings can only be used while immaterial. Inhabiting spirits are considered material, except that they may continue to perform Inhabitings, and become immaterial if they leave their host.</p>

            <p>The spirit possesses an object, requiring Essence and Temperance scores greater than an artifact&rsquo;s level if the target is an artifact. (Possessed artifacts that require attunement to function still require that attunement.) The spirit may then activate the object and use it as its designer intended. The spirit may use its own traits to accomplish things from within the object, but Attribute scores are limited to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence, and Abilities are limited to its Temperance. For instance, a spirit inhabiting a daiklave may swing it with ([lower of Dexterity or Essence] + [lower of Melee or Temperance]); the sword&rsquo;s bonuses would still count. A spirit in an Essence cannon could fire the cannon. Spirits possessing armor could walk the empty suits around. For the purposes of this Charm, &ldquo;an object&rdquo; needs to be a self-contained unit, but it may consist of multiple components, such as a suit of armor or a magitech artifact.</p>
<p>By spending another 10 motes and one Willpower point, a spirit of Essence 3+ can imbue its possessed object with a certain level of flexibility. This might move the object in weird ways or allow it to be used it in a way it wasn&rsquo;t designed to be used.</p>
<p>Spirits possessing objects can be recognized by anyone who can see the immaterial. Another spirit with domain over the inhabited object and higher Essence can eject the possessing spirit just by wishing to, but this takes a scene.</p>

            <p>This Charm has two effects. If the spirit touches a host and a successful roll of the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Temperance) is made against an external penalty of a possessing spirit&rsquo;s ([Essence + Temperance] / 2), it may eject the current inhabitant. Second, if this Charm is used while another character is attempting to eject or exercise the spirit from its host, it may activate this Charm to add an external penalty of (spirit&rsquo;s Temperance) to any rolls to do so. Any character who is successfully rebuked through either effect of this Charm by a spirit with a higher Essence than her own loses a number of Willpower points, is knocked back a number of yards and is considered Inactive for a number of actions equal to the difference in Essence scores.</p>

            <p>The spirit erodes the soul of a creature the spirit&rsquo;s inhabiting. It attacks a part of its host&rsquo;s soul, usually a Virtue or Willpower, and its player rolls (Essence + Temperance), applying an external penalty of (the host&rsquo;s Essence). If the spirit scores more successes than the rating of the trait the spirit wishes to damage, that trait is reduced by one dot. If this power is used again on the same target within a week, successes from earlier in the week carry over; but once a dot has been lost, accumulated successes vanish.</p>
<p>The traits of an Exalt or similarly fortified creature will return at a rate of one dot per week once the spirit stops hollowing her soul, but mortal traits don&rsquo;t recover without magical aid.</p>
<p>If a spirit possesses at least four more dots of permanent Essence than the spirit&rsquo;s target, the spirit may also attack the host&rsquo;s permanent Essence, but must score (5 x normal) successes to damage that trait. Exalts are immune to this effect.</p>
<p>If the motes powering this Charm are committed for a full day, the spirit works slowly. It may attempt to conceal its actions, represented by a (Manipulation + Temperance) roll, suffering a (host&rsquo;s [Perception + Occult] / 2) external penalty; but if the spirit is successful, the target is unaware of the attack even if one of her traits loses a dot.</p>
<p>Hosts reduced to 0 Willpower can&rsquo;t contest Inhabitings.</p>

            <p>The spirit exists in an object or natural feature. While inhabiting it, the spirit senses only its host and what touches it, and cannot affect its host in any way. Thus tucked away, the spirit can&rsquo;t easily be analyzed; only its existence can be detected, and then only through the use of thaumaturgy or similar powers that examine objects spiritually. Measure the Wind, Essence sight and other such generic powers don&rsquo;t differentiate objects containing spirits using this Charm from those that don&rsquo;t.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit fills a gap in a mortal soul. While dematerialized, the spirit must &ldquo;touch&rdquo; the target and select one of her Virtues; if the spirit&rsquo;s Essence exceeds both the target&rsquo;s Essence and the selected Virtue, then roll the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Temperance). This roll suffers an external penalty of the target&rsquo;s (Essence + [higher of selected Virtue or Integrity]). If the spirit uses Possession while or immediately after the target takes an act on an action that forced him to override a Virtue of 3+ (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 102), that Virtue counts as 2.</p>
<p>If the roll is successful, the spirit may take control of the target&rsquo;s actions whenever it sees fit. The target loses all control. The spirit must use the host&rsquo;s Physical Attributes. The spirit may, but doesn&rsquo;t have to, use the host&rsquo;s voice and senses. Without using Charms, it can&rsquo;t perform physical actions that the host can&rsquo;t. The host retains her attunements, and if the spirit knows how, it may use the host&rsquo;s artifacts. Any physical properties of the host are the spirit&rsquo;s to command, but it can&rsquo;t draw on the host&rsquo;s Essence or use her Charms (Charms that were already active instantly end when the spirit floods into its target).</p>
<p>The player of a host with a permanent Willpower score of 1 or higher can at any time make a (Willpower + Integrity) roll, adding (Essence) successes, in an attempt to regain control from the spirit. The spirit&rsquo;s player resists with a (Willpower + Temperance) roll, adding (Essence) successes. If the spirit wins, it retains control, and the host loses one Willpower point. If the host wins, he gains control for a number of actions equal to the successes scored in excess of the spirit&rsquo;s player&rsquo;s roll, and the spirit loses one Willpower point. If the host scores successes in excess of the spirit&rsquo;s successes equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Temperance, the spirit is ejected. Hosts may not regain Willpower while possessed.</p>
<p>If a spirit uses Possession on a target reduced to zero permanent Willpower (most often through Hollow out the Soul, see p. 160), the Charm&rsquo;s duration becomes indefinite.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit enters a willing host. The result is often an uncomfortable amalgam of man and spirit vying for consciousness, thought and dominance, but sometimes, a true and beneficial union occurs. If either spirit or host boasts three or more dots of permanent Essence than the other, or they don&rsquo;t have similar positive Intimacies toward each other, the union will be incomplete. Otherwise, after an uninterrupted month of this Charm, the union becomes complete.</p>
<p>In an incomplete union, the partner with the highest Essence dominates, and the gestalt entity has the dominant partner&rsquo;s traits. Only the dominant character may use her Charms, but gains the use of (spirit&rsquo;s Temperance) of the other character&rsquo;s Charms. These are chosen by the spirit when it begins its ride. The dominant character uses the formula that she&rsquo;d normally use to compute her Essence pool, but if either character was an Exalt, all their motes become peripheral.</p>
<p>In a complete union, the personalities mix, keeping no secrets from each other. A number of traits equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Temperance use the highest of their two scores— these are the traits with the largest difference between spirit and host, and are never Willpower or Essence The traits that don&rsquo;t use the higher of the two characters&rsquo; scores are averaged and rounded up, including Willpower and Essence. Furthermore, the pair may use all their Charms and may even Combo them normally. The team uses the most advantageous of the two formulas for calculating their Essence pool, but if either of the characters was an Exalt, their motes are still all peripheral.</p>
<p>No matter what, both characters retain their Virtues and can channel through either set as usual. Whenever the gestalt entity faces circumstances that challenge Virtues, each partner must check for Virtues influencing behavior separately. A gestalt with two Valor scores each at 4 would have to fail two subsequent Valor checks to stand down from a martial challenge.</p>
<p>In the mists of prehistory, the patron gods of the Dragon Kings merged with the saurian race&rsquo;s heroes to become <em>olchiliké</em>, which means &ldquo;Chosen&rdquo; in High Holy Speech (this name was later appropriated by mortals and applied to the Exalted). Some gods near Rathess still possess Ride, but it&rsquo;s rare throughout the rest of Creation. The Immaculate Order especially considers this power blasphemy and acts against spirits known to use it.</p>

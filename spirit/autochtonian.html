            <p>The various gods and spirits of Autochthonia as a whole draw from the same body of Charms available to the gods of Creation and Yu-Shan. Yet, Autochthonian gods also have access to a body of specialized Charms specifically designed to facilitate their role as the custodians of a Primordial&rsquo;s slumbering corpus. The following Charms are relatively common among ministerial subroutines, elementals and other machine spirits, but are by no means the only custom Charms available to them.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The gods of Creation would be appalled by this Charm if they knew of its existence, but the gods of Autochthonia are far less squeamish about matters of &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; where survival is concerned. The subroutine can consume the material form of another subroutine in order to replenish and repair herself. Most often, Cannibalize is used on subroutines that have been damaged beyond repair by some harmful force. In such a case, the subroutine invoking the Charm must consume the body of her fallen peer, healing two bashing or lethal health levels per action, up to a maximum equal to half the total health levels of the destroyed subroutine. This Charm can also be use offensively, however, usually either by or against a gremlin. When deployed in this manner, the attacking subroutine makes a close-range attack with the Ability of its choice, gaining one health level for each level of damage done to the target, up to a maximum number of health levels equal to the attacker&rsquo;s Valor. This Charm can only be deployed in this manner <em>after</em> the targeted subroutine has already suffered at least four health levels of damage, however.</p>
<p>Subroutines may use Cannibalize to obtain Essence, from both willing and unwilling targets. The attacking spirit can spend two motes of Essence to drain five motes from the targeted subroutine, for a net gain of three motes. Alternatively, the subroutine can spend a point of Willpower to steal 10 motes from the other subroutine. In either case, if the other subroutine is not willing, he must have already suffered at least four health levels of damage for this Charm to be effective against him.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm is unique to crystal elementals. It allows the elemental to transmute part of another creature&rsquo;s physical form into a crystalline structure. The spirit must first touch the target, which could require a Martial Arts attack. Then the elemental&rsquo;s player must roll the spirit&rsquo;s Essence. Each success inflicts one level of aggravated damage as parts of the target&rsquo;s body instantly crystallize. Exalted can soak this damage with Essence. If a target loses all of its health levels to this Charm, he is transformed into a statue of pure crystal. This effect can be reversed within 24 hours by magic capable of healing aggravated damage, but after that point, the affected creature is slain.</p>

            <p>This Charm is most common among metal elementals but is not unique to them. While the Charm lasts, the spirit is completely immune to damage inflicted by metal weapons. This protection does not extend to weapons made out of one of the magical materials, but a superior version of this Charm exists (requiring Essence 6) that does allow for such protection.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm is unique to crystal elementals and design weavers. It allows a spirit to disrupt the Essence patterns of a target, bringing her out of harmony with local Essence structures. The spirit must first touch the target, which could require a successful (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll. Once contact has been made, no further roll is required. The target automatically loses the ability to recover Essence from any source while the effect lasts, and all Essence costs are doubled. Against Fair Folk (but not Mountain Folk), this Charm instead inflicts aggravated damage equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence with a successful touch.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm is common among gremlins but is not unique to them. The spirit must touch a machine, a machine spirit or an automaton, which could require a successful (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll. The Charm does not inflict any damage on the target. Instead, it weakens the target&rsquo;s structural integrity. Each successful application of the Charm reduces the target&rsquo;s natural soak by 1L/1B (to a minimum of 0). If both of the target&rsquo;s soak totals are reduced to 0, the next successful application destroys the target.</p>

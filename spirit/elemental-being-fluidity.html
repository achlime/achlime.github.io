        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit understands the malleability at the core of all elementals. Just as the elements change and shift over time, so do elementals. This charm hurries along that process and directs these changes toward a direction desired by the spirit.</p>
<p>This Charm can be used only on elementals. The target elemental must be willing or unconscious, and have an Essence rating of (Essence - 1) for Water elementals or (Essence - 3) for elementals of a different element. An elemental may always use this charm on itself.</p>
<p>Each activation of this Charm allows you to perform one of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift up to (target&rsquo;s Essence) points between their Attributes.</li>
<li>Shift up to (target&rsquo;s Essence × 2) points between their Abilities and Specialties. Note that points must remain with the same kind of traits, i.e., specialties can only be shifted into specialities, and abilities can only be shifted into abilities. Furthermore, specialties can only be shifted into specialties at least somewhat related to the specialty the points are shifted away from.</li>
<li>Allow up to (target&rsquo;s Essence ÷ 2, rounded up) shifts of points between Virtues or changes in Intimacies. Since Intimacies do not have ratings each added, removed or changed Intimacy counts as 1 &ldquo;shift&rdquo;. E.g., a target elemental with Essence 3 allows for two shifts. It can have one point shifted from Temperance to Conviction, and have one Intimacy added at the same time. It could also have two of its intimacies changed to two different intimacies.</li>
<li>Allow for changing up to (target&rsquo;s Essence) worth of Charms. Since Charms do not have ratings, this is determined by looking at minimum Essence requirements of the groups of added and removed charms. For each group the sum of the minimum Essence requirement may be at most (target&rsquo;s Essence), and the sums of two groups must be equal. Note that even slightly changing a charm counts as both adding and removing the charm.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible, at a surcharge of 1wp per dot, to use this charm to grant additional dots to the elemental. Each added dot will count as a &ldquo;shift&rdquo;, and traits may only be increased in this way up to the rating of the spirit using the charm. This use of the charm adds the Training keyword.</p>
<p>After an elemental is affected by this Charm, it cannot be used again on that elemental for a week. The elemental must be given time to let the changes settle as part of its core being, and this charm is not be able to affect an elemental still in the process of settling.</p>
<p>Note that this Charm cannot be used to directly change the Motivation of the elemental. After changing the elemental&rsquo;s virtues and intimacies its Motivation is adjusted by the Storyteller, informed by the wishes of the player of the character that used the charm.</p>

            <p>Spirits devour life with these Charms.</p>
<p>How a spirit sustains itself matters. A spirit&rsquo;s form shifts to match the resonance of the Essence on which it subsists. The changes occur subtly over time, but mindful spirits can see them happening. Weak or easily manipulated spirits might show signs after a season, while stronger spirits remain unchanged for years, even centuries.</p>

            <p>The spirit consumes another willing (or Incapacitated) spirit, inflicting up to its Essence in aggravated levels of damage. For every such health level, the cannibalizing spirit converts one lethal health level of damage to bashing or recovers five motes.</p>
<p>Instead of inflicting a level of aggravated damage to the target, a spirit can also drain one Willpower point or 10 motes. If the spirit cannibalizes a being of higher Essence, the spirit may also recover one Willpower point for every two health levels, but can&rsquo;t bring its own temporary Willpower higher than its Temperance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that, for the purposes of this Charm, Exaltations and the souls of living humans aren&rsquo;t spirits.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit touches its target and its player rolls (Essence + Temperance), with an external penalty of (the target&rsquo;s Essence). If the target actively resists, she may add half her permanent Willpower to the external penalty; she can also consent, and thereby remove all penalties. Every success steals three motes of Essence, which go right to the spirit. If it scores three or more successes, it may steal one Willpower point instead of motes.</p>
<p>A spirit stealing from a creature without an Essence pool still gains Essence or Willpower; the creature just pays the cost in other ways. She suffers a Crippling or Sickness effect that inflicts at least an internal penalty equal to the spirit&rsquo;s successes. This effect vanishes within a day from magically fortified creatures, but mortals must be treated normally. What sort of Crippling or Sickness effect the Charm inflicts depends on the spirit.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit flavors a mortal&rsquo;s Essence with divine power and drinks in the nectar of her joy. Repeated targets of this Charm become enthralled with the parasitic spirit, longing for the magical feeling of power and completion.</p>
<p>This Charm supplements a social attack designed to build an Intimacy toward the spirit. If the attack is successful, the spirit invests a mote into the target for one week, and cannot retrieve the mote early. In exchange, it regains (target&rsquo;s Essence x 3) motes. (The spirit can stack the effect to receive [target&rsquo;s Essence x 3] motes for every mote still in the target, to a maximum of [Temperance] motes.) If the target has an Intimacy toward the spirit, the spirit also regains one Willpower point.</p>
<p>While this Charm is active, the target is counted as having at least as many scenes devoted to building an Intimacy toward the spirit as the number of motes invested in her. If the spirit has more motes in a target than her Conviction, she cannot even begin to break her commitment to the Intimacy while the Charm lasts.</p>
<p>Each victim&rsquo;s hourly mote respiration rate is reduced by the number of motes invested in her. If this would bring her respiration rate to below 0 (as is always the case with mortals), she counts her permanent Willpower as one lower for each point below 0. Finally, if the target has an Intimacy to the spirit, and the spirit achieves a threshold on the original social attack greater than (target&rsquo;s Temperance), the target also suffers from an Emotion effect that forces her to spend two Willpower per day to avoid feeling so devoted to the spirit that she&rsquo;s practically its slave.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit flavors a mortal&rsquo;s Essence with divine power and drinks in the nectar of her joy. Repeated targets of this Charm become enthralled with the parasitic spirit, longing for the magical feeling of power and completion.</p>
<p>This Charm supplements a social attack designed to build an Intimacy toward the spirit. If the attack is successful, the spirit invests a mote into the target for one week, and cannot retrieve the mote early. In exchange, it regains (target&rsquo;s Essence x 3) motes. (The spirit can stack the effect to receive [target&rsquo;s Essence x 3] motes for every mote still in the target, to a maximum of [Temperance] motes.) If the target has an Intimacy toward the spirit, the spirit also regains one Willpower point.</p>
<p>While this Charm is active, the target is counted as having at least as many scenes devoted to building an Intimacy toward the spirit as the number of motes invested in her. If the spirit has more motes in a target than her Conviction, she cannot even begin to break her commitment to the Intimacy while the Charm lasts.</p>
<p>Each victim&rsquo;s hourly mote respiration rate is reduced by the number of motes invested in her. If this would bring her respiration rate to below 0 (as is always the case with mortals), she counts her permanent Willpower as one lower for each point below 0. Finally, if the target has an Intimacy to the spirit, and the spirit achieves a threshold on the original social attack greater than (target&rsquo;s Temperance), the target also suffers from an Emotion effect that forces her to spend two Willpower per day to avoid feeling so devoted to the spirit that she&rsquo;s practically its slave.</p>

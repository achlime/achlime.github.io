        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Mind-Knife Sacrament reshapes the target&rsquo;s mind. This Charm works only if the spirit is able to repeatedly and freely touch the target during the social action, which requires either restraining the target, or trust. The spirit issues a social attack using ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Temperance), which only the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value may defend against. Successes may seal off or bestow Abilities, Virtues, Intimacies or memories, or bestow priesthood. Sealed traits cannot be used as prerequisites for Charms, and characters who lack the prerequisites for their Charms lose access to those powers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability dots may not be raised by more than 1, and may not be caused to exceed the spirit&rsquo;s own. They can be reduced to as low as 0. Ability dots require three successes per dot to add or remove.</li>
<li>Virtue dots also require three successes per dot to add or remove, but the spirit&rsquo;s own Virtues are not a limitation.</li>
<li>Intimacies cost one success per scene&rsquo;s worth of building or eroding the Intimacy, and the spirit must possess the Intimacy, or a similar one, to bestow it.</li>
<li>Memories cost one success per scene&rsquo;s worth of memory. Removing elements from larger sections of time requires five successes. Rewriting life-long memories requires 10 successes.</li>
<li>Priesthood costs five successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raising a target&rsquo;s traits puts the target into experience debt per normal for training effects.</p>
<p>Large-scale revisions to a target&rsquo;s mind are possible because repeated uses of this Charm are cumulative; however, every success applied to the target saps one Willpower from the target, or deals one unsoakable aggravated level of damage if the target runs out of Willpower. When this Charm is used to lower traits, the effects of this Charm are temporary. Every time the target dreams, and every time she is placed in a new situation in which her old mind has an opportunity to resurface, such as a warrior who has lost Melee wielding a new familiar weapon, the target automatically rolls (Wits + Integrity). Successes on this roll negate the Charm&rsquo;s successes that have been applied to her. Mortals suffer a -1 external penalty to this roll.</p>
<p>The roll for this Charm suffers a cumulative -1 external penalty for every use on a single target. These negated successes still damage the target.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit enters a willing host. The result is often an uncomfortable amalgam of man and spirit vying for consciousness, thought and dominance, but sometimes, a true and beneficial union occurs. If either spirit or host boasts three or more dots of permanent Essence than the other, or they don&rsquo;t have similar positive Intimacies toward each other, the union will be incomplete. Otherwise, after an uninterrupted month of this Charm, the union becomes complete.</p>
<p>In an incomplete union, the partner with the highest Essence dominates, and the gestalt entity has the dominant partner&rsquo;s traits. Only the dominant character may use her Charms, but gains the use of (spirit&rsquo;s Temperance) of the other character&rsquo;s Charms. These are chosen by the spirit when it begins its ride. The dominant character uses the formula that she&rsquo;d normally use to compute her Essence pool, but if either character was an Exalt, all their motes become peripheral.</p>
<p>In a complete union, the personalities mix, keeping no secrets from each other. A number of traits equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Temperance use the highest of their two scores— these are the traits with the largest difference between spirit and host, and are never Willpower or Essence The traits that don&rsquo;t use the higher of the two characters&rsquo; scores are averaged and rounded up, including Willpower and Essence. Furthermore, the pair may use all their Charms and may even Combo them normally. The team uses the most advantageous of the two formulas for calculating their Essence pool, but if either of the characters was an Exalt, their motes are still all peripheral.</p>
<p>No matter what, both characters retain their Virtues and can channel through either set as usual. Whenever the gestalt entity faces circumstances that challenge Virtues, each partner must check for Virtues influencing behavior separately. A gestalt with two Valor scores each at 4 would have to fail two subsequent Valor checks to stand down from a martial challenge.</p>
<p>In the mists of prehistory, the patron gods of the Dragon Kings merged with the saurian race&rsquo;s heroes to become <em>olchiliké</em>, which means &ldquo;Chosen&rdquo; in High Holy Speech (this name was later appropriated by mortals and applied to the Exalted). Some gods near Rathess still possess Ride, but it&rsquo;s rare throughout the rest of Creation. The Immaculate Order especially considers this power blasphemy and acts against spirits known to use it.</p>

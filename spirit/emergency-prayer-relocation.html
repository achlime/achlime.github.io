        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a spirit receives a prayer, the spirit may invoke Emergency Prayer Relocation to travel to the petitioner in less than a scene, no matter how far away the prayer is. The actual time taken depends on the target&rsquo;s distance from the spirit—generally one tick per 100 miles.</p>
<p>Because the spirit&rsquo;s departure is so hasty, the spirit cannot take its entire Essence along. When the spirit arrives, its Essence score is limited to the number of threshold successes the target scored on her prayer roll, and it cannot use Charms with Essence minimums greater than the new Essence score. Furthermore, the spirit cannot remain divided. After taking (Conviction) actions (or up to [Conviction x 6] minutes if it engages only in behavior with no mechanical effect, such as conversing without using social combat), the spirit returns whence it came. The spirit is aware of the strength of the target&rsquo;s prayer and must decide whether such a hasty move is worth the risk.</p>
<p>The spirit finds dividing its Essence arduous. Every time a spirit uses this Charm in a single scene after the first, the spirit suffers one level of unsoakable aggravated damage.</p>

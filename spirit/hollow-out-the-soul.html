        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit erodes the soul of a creature the spirit&rsquo;s inhabiting. It attacks a part of its host&rsquo;s soul, usually a Virtue or Willpower, and its player rolls (Essence + Temperance), applying an external penalty of (the host&rsquo;s Essence). If the spirit scores more successes than the rating of the trait the spirit wishes to damage, that trait is reduced by one dot. If this power is used again on the same target within a week, successes from earlier in the week carry over; but once a dot has been lost, accumulated successes vanish.</p>
<p>The traits of an Exalt or similarly fortified creature will return at a rate of one dot per week once the spirit stops hollowing her soul, but mortal traits don&rsquo;t recover without magical aid.</p>
<p>If a spirit possesses at least four more dots of permanent Essence than the spirit&rsquo;s target, the spirit may also attack the host&rsquo;s permanent Essence, but must score (5 x normal) successes to damage that trait. Exalts are immune to this effect.</p>
<p>If the motes powering this Charm are committed for a full day, the spirit works slowly. It may attempt to conceal its actions, represented by a (Manipulation + Temperance) roll, suffering a (host&rsquo;s [Perception + Occult] / 2) external penalty; but if the spirit is successful, the target is unaware of the attack even if one of her traits loses a dot.</p>
<p>Hosts reduced to 0 Willpower can&rsquo;t contest Inhabitings.</p>

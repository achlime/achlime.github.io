            <p>Attacks supplemented by this Charm do aggravated damage. If the spirit&rsquo;s attack is useful against objects, it instead ignores the object&rsquo;s soak and Hardness. The limited nature of this Charm deserves special mention, as aggravated damage is particularly dangerous. There is no All-Encompassing Bane Weapon Charm; every spirit with Bane Weapon can inflict aggravated damage only upon a narrow range of creatures. For example, the demon Octavian (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 309) may deal aggravated damage to earth elementals. Groups such as &ldquo;all elementals&rdquo; and &ldquo;all mortals&rdquo; are too broad for this Charm to encompass, though &ldquo;all redheads,&rdquo; &ldquo;all djala&rdquo; or even &ldquo;all men&rdquo; would be possible. This Charm cannot distinguish between the Exalted and the unExalted, so no spirit has a Bane Weapon Charm that deals damage to all Exalted in general, all Solars, all Dragon-Blooded or the like. Generally speaking, this Charm is not used to represent increased competence against a particular opposed group; instead, this Charm is the manifestation of a grudge or vendetta that lies orthogonal to the spirit&rsquo;s assigned purpose.</p>

            <p>The spirit does damage to every creature that strikes the spirit, touches it or is struck by it. The Charm can deal bashing damage at a cost of one mote per die, lethal damage for two motes per die or aggravated damage for four motes per die. Lethal damage requires the spirit to have at least two Essence. Aggravated damage requires four Essence. No more than ([Essence x 2] + Valor) motes may be spent per invocation.</p>
<p>A more potent effect—inflicting health levels rather than dice, and bypassing armor—would raise the cost by one mote per health level and the Charm&rsquo;s minimum Essence by 1. If the damage takes the form of an element, this Charm carries the <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#elemental" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Elemental'"><span class="link-focus">Elemental</span></a> keyword.</p>

            <p>The spirit converts an attack&rsquo;s damage into a Crippling effect, a Poison effect, a Sickness effect, a wound penalty, a Shaping effect or an unnatural mental influence (pick one). Until the spirit&rsquo;s next action, all the target&rsquo;s non-reflexive dice pools are reduced by (spirit&rsquo;s Essence), or one of her traits is reduced by (spirit&rsquo;s Essence/2). For every three dots of (Essence + Valor) the spirit possesses, it may include an additional reason for the effect in the attack: for instance, a spirit with 6 (Essence + Valor) might inflict paralysis that&rsquo;s both a Sickness and a Poison effect.</p>
<p>A target immune to all the associated keywords, or with an Essence higher than the spirit&rsquo;s, is immune to its version of Paralyze. Other targets resist Paralyze with a successful (Stamina + Resistance) roll, with an external penalty of the spirit&rsquo;s Valor.</p>

            <p>The spirit unleashes a cacophonic shout, a crushing wave of energy or some other all-encompassing attack on the area around it. The blast affects all creatures and/or objects within (Essence x 10) yards, and is either unblockable or undodgable. Whichever mode of defense works requires a Defense Value equal to the spirit&rsquo;s (Valor + Any Attribute) to avoid. Damage from the attack is equal to the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Valor + Attribute). This damage is usually bashing, but spirits of Essence 5+ may spend an additional five motes and one Willpower to convert the damage to piercing bashing or lethal damage. Shatter is a natural attack. If the spirit uses other Charms to supplement Shatter, count it as a number of attacks equal to the spirit&rsquo;s ([Essence + Valor + Attribute] / 2).</p>

            <p>Attacks supplemented by this Charm affect the material world. Subtract 5 from the spirit&rsquo;s effective Essence when enhancing the attack—the spirit cannot invoke other Charms that require a minimum Essence higher than the modified figure, and those Charms use the modified figure to calculate their effects.</p>
<p>Unlike other Edges, Shattered Adamant Attack can obviously be used while immaterial; the attack itself becomes material before it begins, though, which might allow the target a roll to notice it. This also means other Edges can enhance it. If a spirit invokes this Charm more than (Valor) times in one scene, every additional use inflicts an unsoakable aggravated health level upon the spirit as its substance is lost in the rapid transition to materiality and back.</p>

            <p>The blessing of an Elemental Dragon is upon the spirit, for harmful elemental energies become beautiful dancing dragons, butterflies or simple streams of power as they course into its hungry chakra, which glow in acceptance. The spirit has access to all of the benefits of Elemental Rejuvenation (see p. 170), and this Charm supersedes that power. Furthermore, if the spirit would be damaged by an effect of its chosen element, the spirit may spend two motes to perfectly and completely negate the damage from that effect. For every three dice or one health level of raw damage that the effect would have inflicted, the spirit instead heals one level of damage or regains one mote.</p>

            <p>The spirit has reached an accord with destiny that shields the spirit from most casual troubles. This sacred contract imposes an external penalty equal to the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Valor) to most rolls which could opposed by the spirit&rsquo;s Resistance, Integrity, or Dodge, even if the spirit is unaware of the effect. The spirit also gains soak equal to its (Essence + Valor) against most lethal or bashing damage. The only things that bypass this power are Essence-enhanced effects intended to affect the spirit specifically and the machinations of character with a Destiny (see <strong>Scroll of the Monk</strong>, pp. 151-152) greater than the spirit&rsquo;s ([Essence + Valor] / 2). This Charm has no effect during Calibration.</p>
<p>The Destiny Sponsorship contract involves a number of taboos and restrictions equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence, which she must always observe. Any spirit who fails to observe these taboos loses the effects of this Charm and cannot reactivate it until Calibration.</p>
<p>Any spirit requested to state the conditions of its Destiny Sponsorship in Old Realm must immediately and honestly do so, lest the spirit lose the benefits.</p>

            <p>The spirit briefly dematerializes, avoiding material consequences and removing material afflictions. The instant this Charm is used, the spirit dematerializes. On the tick the Charm is used, its action switches to Inactive. During this time, all effects not designed to affect immaterial being pass through it harmlessly. Ongoing Crippling, Poison and Sickness effects not specifically designed to affect immaterial spirits become heavy vestments, imbedded weapons and sucking leeches on the spirit&rsquo;s immaterial form. It automatically knows which hindrances relate to which effects and may remove a number of them equal to its Valor. Effects created through magic resist being cast off, and the spirit must score successes equal to the Essence rating of the effect on a roll of (Essence + Valor). Failure not only means that the spirit cannot remove the item, but also that the spirit has spent the rest of its action trying. Attempts to remove effects backed by an Essence score higher than the spirit&rsquo;s automatically fail. At the conclusion of this Charm, the spirit rematerializes in the same place that it was before.</p>
<p>If the immaterial items created by this Charm are replaced on the spirit, then their effects resume.</p>

            <p>A glowing rune symbolizing the spirit&rsquo;s domain appears surrounding it, announcing to all things its divine authority over its concept. The spirit becomes effectively immune to its domain. Poison, Sickness and Crippling effects originating from the spirit&rsquo;s domain all mean nothing. The spirit&rsquo;s even immune to such effects caused only in part by its domain, unless they&rsquo;re backed by an Essence greater than its Valor. Raw damage related to the spirit&rsquo;s domain is reduced to 0 before any added by Charms. If the spirit&rsquo;s domain has a social component, the spirit may create a temporary magical Intimacy involving its domain. Any mental influence opposing this Intimacy counts as an unacceptable order.</p>

            <p>The target gains an immense boon. This Charm can grant dots of traits such as Attributes, Abilities, Willpower, Virtues—even Essence. Endowment can grant the use of Charms. It can even grant physical or metaphysical alterations. Almost any sort of boon is possible, though generally the spirit possess that quality itself. The minimum Essence of this Charm is determined by the granted power, and the mote cost is equal to triple the final minimum Essence. When bestowing trait dots, increase the minimum Essence by two for every dot gifted after the first. Blessing a target beyond her normal potential—for instance, beyond five Attribute dots or one Essence for a mortal—increases the minimum Essence by two more.</p>
<p>If an Endowment bestows the use of a Charm, then use the minimum Essence of the bestowed Charm (if higher than that of Endowment). If it bestows the effects of a Charm, on the other hand, the duration of the Endowment is limited to the duration of the gifted Charm, and the spirit must pay the cost of the Endowment plus the cost of the bestowed Charm.</p>
<p>Endowments that grant physical benefits other than Charms or trait dots can be modeled with the &ldquo;Touch of the Wyld&rdquo; section on pages 288-290 of <strong>Exalted</strong>. (Even more such benefits may be found on pp. 144-148 of <strong>The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II—The Wyld</strong> and on pp. 206-209 of <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Lunars</strong>.) Endowment can add positive qualities or remove negative ones. If the Endowment is about as useful as an affliction or heals a problem as bad as a debility, add one to this Charm&rsquo;s minimum Essence. Blights and deformities raise minimum Essence by two; abominations by three.</p>
<p>Most spirits have one unique version of this Charm that bestows a combination of effects. If a spirit&rsquo;s Endowment grants dots of various traits, physical changes and Charm effects, use the highest minimum Essence of all of the effects and add one for every additional effect.</p>

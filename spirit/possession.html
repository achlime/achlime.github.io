        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit fills a gap in a mortal soul. While dematerialized, the spirit must &ldquo;touch&rdquo; the target and select one of her Virtues; if the spirit&rsquo;s Essence exceeds both the target&rsquo;s Essence and the selected Virtue, then roll the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Temperance). This roll suffers an external penalty of the target&rsquo;s (Essence + [higher of selected Virtue or Integrity]). If the spirit uses Possession while or immediately after the target takes an act on an action that forced him to override a Virtue of 3+ (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 102), that Virtue counts as 2.</p>
<p>If the roll is successful, the spirit may take control of the target&rsquo;s actions whenever it sees fit. The target loses all control. The spirit must use the host&rsquo;s Physical Attributes. The spirit may, but doesn&rsquo;t have to, use the host&rsquo;s voice and senses. Without using Charms, it can&rsquo;t perform physical actions that the host can&rsquo;t. The host retains her attunements, and if the spirit knows how, it may use the host&rsquo;s artifacts. Any physical properties of the host are the spirit&rsquo;s to command, but it can&rsquo;t draw on the host&rsquo;s Essence or use her Charms (Charms that were already active instantly end when the spirit floods into its target).</p>
<p>The player of a host with a permanent Willpower score of 1 or higher can at any time make a (Willpower + Integrity) roll, adding (Essence) successes, in an attempt to regain control from the spirit. The spirit&rsquo;s player resists with a (Willpower + Temperance) roll, adding (Essence) successes. If the spirit wins, it retains control, and the host loses one Willpower point. If the host wins, he gains control for a number of actions equal to the successes scored in excess of the spirit&rsquo;s player&rsquo;s roll, and the spirit loses one Willpower point. If the host scores successes in excess of the spirit&rsquo;s successes equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Temperance, the spirit is ejected. Hosts may not regain Willpower while possessed.</p>
<p>If a spirit uses Possession on a target reduced to zero permanent Willpower (most often through Hollow out the Soul, see p. 160), the Charm&rsquo;s duration becomes indefinite.</p>

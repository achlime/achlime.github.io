            <p>Spirits send dreams to their worshipers and visions to their priests, and often manipulate humanity from a distance. A spirit can use a Sending on a target within Creation from within the spirit&rsquo;s own sanctum, but Sending can only enter the sanctum of a willing spirit and cannot otherwise cross between realms of existence. A spirit doesn&rsquo;t necessarily know if its Sending failed to reach the target.</p>
<p>Sendings may reach material targets, even if the spirit itself is immaterial.</p>

            <p>The target receives a dream of the spirit&rsquo;s design. Sleepers can enter only one such dreamscape per period of sleep. If more than one spirit seeks to place a target within a dreamscape during the same period of sleep, the highest-Essence spirit&rsquo;s dream takes precedence. In case of ties, the target enters the dreamscape sent first. A spirit may commit the motes for this Charm, specifying that it activates as soon as the target is willing to receive the dream or falls asleep, but won&rsquo;t necessarily know when that happens. Most spirits with this Charm may send dreams only to mortals the spirits can see, though they may do so while immaterial. Spirits with Essence 6+ may send dreams (Essence x Compassion x 100) miles.</p>
<p>From within the dream, the target may receive any message of any length—through this message, the spirit may deliver a social attack that gains twice the normal benefit from using the target&rsquo;s Intimacies, Virtues or Motivations against him, up to a maximum bonus equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Compassion. If the spirit is activating this Charm while the target sleeps, the spirit may enter the dream and communicate with her in real time, in which case the spirit may deliver one social attack at the above bonus or hold a regular conversation, including the possibility of participating in regular social combat where the spirit&rsquo;s as vulnerable to the dreamer as the dreamer is to it. The dream message may also constitute up to a full day&rsquo;s worth of training. Finally, the dream can simply be a nightmare, designed to prevent the target from regaining Willpower upon waking.</p>
<p>For one Willpower, spirits with an Essence score greater than the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value can force conscious targets into a dream, which lasts but a moment, though its effects may be profound. Targets may lower their Dodge Mental Defense Value voluntarily should they wish to receive such a dream.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit uses its understanding of immortality to place itself and its targets outside of time. While this Essence is committed, the spirit (or another of its Sendings) and a number of targets up to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence depart the normal flow of time and enter into a mass dream. This effect is usually consensual, but targets with a Dodge Mental Defense Value greater than the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Compassion) may choose to be unaffected. One spirit may cause the world to appear to freeze in place. Another may appear to transport itself and its targets to a far away location or to a location the spirit imagines. There, the spirit and its targets may wage social combat between the blows of a sword or strategize in the midst of a battle. Once the committed Essence is released, all the participants return to exactly where they were just before this Charm was used.</p>
<p>What happens in the dream is purely social. No changes whatsoever last beyond the end of the conversation save the effects of social combat, with the special exception of Compassion Charms invoked during that &ldquo;time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A player who wants her character to leave the dream world may spend three Willpower to do so.</p>
<p>This Charm may be used a number of times per scene equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Compassion.</p>

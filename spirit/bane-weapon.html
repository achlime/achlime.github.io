            <p>Attacks supplemented by this Charm do aggravated damage. If the spirit&rsquo;s attack is useful against objects, it instead ignores the object&rsquo;s soak and Hardness. The limited nature of this Charm deserves special mention, as aggravated damage is particularly dangerous. There is no All-Encompassing Bane Weapon Charm; every spirit with Bane Weapon can inflict aggravated damage only upon a narrow range of creatures. For example, the demon Octavian (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 309) may deal aggravated damage to earth elementals. Groups such as &ldquo;all elementals&rdquo; and &ldquo;all mortals&rdquo; are too broad for this Charm to encompass, though &ldquo;all redheads,&rdquo; &ldquo;all djala&rdquo; or even &ldquo;all men&rdquo; would be possible. This Charm cannot distinguish between the Exalted and the unExalted, so no spirit has a Bane Weapon Charm that deals damage to all Exalted in general, all Solars, all Dragon-Blooded or the like. Generally speaking, this Charm is not used to represent increased competence against a particular opposed group; instead, this Charm is the manifestation of a grudge or vendetta that lies orthogonal to the spirit&rsquo;s assigned purpose.</p>

            <p><em>This Charm is derived from <a class="complex" href="affinity-element-control.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Affinity (Element) Control'"><span class="link-focus">Affinity (Element) Control</span></a>.</em></p>
<p>The spirit has considerable control over a particular element. The spirit may manipulate (Essence) barrels worth of that element equal within (Essence x 10) yards. Every action, each barrel can be used to one of a number of effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elemental Corruption/Purification — The spirit makes its element poisonous, changing sand into toxic salt, befouling waters, etc. The Damage is 1L/minute and the Toxicity is 1. Every additional barrel committed to the poison adds 1 to the damage and 1 to the Toxicity. This poison is only dangerous if internalized. Every barrel contains 100 doses of this poison. With the purification effect, the spirit may cleanse its element, removing poisonous qualities. The spirit may also cleanse its element of diseases with Virulence less than the spirit’s Essence. These effects are permanent.</li>
<li>Elemental Damage — Every barrel adds 1 to the damage of the spirit’s attacks.</li>
<li>Elemental Manifestation — Every barrel allows control over that volume. This control ranges from the creation of crude appendages to simply grab something to the the mimicking of humanoid bodies in fine detail in both structure and motion. Each barrel provides for one body of element of roughly human size, multiple barrels may be used to create larger appendages. These appendages cannot be used to perform attacks, which is done with the Elemental Weapon use of this Charm.</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance — Every barrel adds 1 to the character’s bashing, lethal and aggravated soak values, or triple that amount against damage from the same element. This soak counts as armor.</li>
<li>Elemental Weapon — The spirit may launch attacks with its element, rolling (Wits + Conviction) to hit. This attack has Speed 5, Accuracy +1, base Damage 3B or 3L and a Rate of 1. Every additional barrel committed to an attack adds 1 to the Accuracy and Rate and 3 to the damage. The spirit may make grapple attacks with Elemental Weapon.</li>

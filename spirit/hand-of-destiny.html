        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Using Hand of Destiny, a spirit marks a certain part of its domain for personal attention. The spirit personally decides what must happen, and personally accomplishes that end. Subordinate spirits governing affected domains immediately become aware of their superior&rsquo;s floating decree and level of personal involvement; thus, those spirits also actively work toward the end the Charm is shaping.</p>
<p>By using this Charm, the spirit sets itself upon a path that leads to the spirit&rsquo;s goal. The spirit becomes the Hand of Destiny: an instrument of its own decision to interfere with Creation. The spirit has a perfect, unconscious instinct for everything that brings it closer to success, and often takes great steps toward its larger goal without even realizing its actions were relevant till later.</p>
<p>This Charm is essentially a managerial priority override—it brings the spirit into conflict with the way things will work out &ldquo;naturally.&rdquo; As a result, spirits using this Charm without permission from the Bureau of Destiny risk that Bureau&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

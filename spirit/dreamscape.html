        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The target receives a dream of the spirit&rsquo;s design. Sleepers can enter only one such dreamscape per period of sleep. If more than one spirit seeks to place a target within a dreamscape during the same period of sleep, the highest-Essence spirit&rsquo;s dream takes precedence. In case of ties, the target enters the dreamscape sent first. A spirit may commit the motes for this Charm, specifying that it activates as soon as the target is willing to receive the dream or falls asleep, but won&rsquo;t necessarily know when that happens. Most spirits with this Charm may send dreams only to mortals the spirits can see, though they may do so while immaterial. Spirits with Essence 6+ may send dreams (Essence x Compassion x 100) miles.</p>
<p>From within the dream, the target may receive any message of any length—through this message, the spirit may deliver a social attack that gains twice the normal benefit from using the target&rsquo;s Intimacies, Virtues or Motivations against him, up to a maximum bonus equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Compassion. If the spirit is activating this Charm while the target sleeps, the spirit may enter the dream and communicate with her in real time, in which case the spirit may deliver one social attack at the above bonus or hold a regular conversation, including the possibility of participating in regular social combat where the spirit&rsquo;s as vulnerable to the dreamer as the dreamer is to it. The dream message may also constitute up to a full day&rsquo;s worth of training. Finally, the dream can simply be a nightmare, designed to prevent the target from regaining Willpower upon waking.</p>
<p>For one Willpower, spirits with an Essence score greater than the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value can force conscious targets into a dream, which lasts but a moment, though its effects may be profound. Targets may lower their Dodge Mental Defense Value voluntarily should they wish to receive such a dream.</p>

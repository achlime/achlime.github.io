            <p>The spirit focuses on a problem affecting her domain and issues notice of impending analysis. By the end of the scene, her being resonates with the wise prayers of every aspect of Creation that owes fealty to the spirit. Unless the problem is masked by magic backed by a higher Essence score than the spirit&rsquo;s, the spirit will determine the problem&rsquo;s source, and may then roll (Intelligence + Compassion) to determine how to fix it. Problems well beyond the spirit&rsquo;s normal scope of operations may impose an external penalty to this roll. For instance, if the issue is a Essence 9 Lunar working against the spirit&rsquo;s domain, then the spirit will likely take a large penalty to the spirit&rsquo;s (Intelligence + Compassion) roll—it&rsquo;s really hard to find a solution to a Essence 9 Lunar. The number of threshold successes determines the wisdom of the spirit&rsquo;s conclusions, and subsequent mental rolls made to deal with the problem receive bonus dice equal to those successes.</p>
<p>Subordinate spirits involved in the diagnostic report must pray to issue their decisions, and any such spirit with an Essence score 1 less than the user may attempt to upset the process, creating an external penalty equal to its ([Charisma + Performance] / 2). A greater number of rebellious smaller spirits might also upset this Charm.</p>

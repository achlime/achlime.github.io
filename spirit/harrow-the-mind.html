        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit convinces the target that something is true, supplementing a (Manipulation + Presence) attack, adding (Temperance) successes. If this social attack is successful, the target finds the impossible possible, then probable, then certain: she&rsquo;s forced to believe the spirit. She sees things the spirit says are there, feels what the spirit says she feels; she may explicitly act on this information however she wishes, but shw cannot doubt that it&rsquo;s true. Spending one Willpower allows her to disbelieve the illusion for a single action; once the target has spent as many points of Willpower as the spirit&rsquo;s Essence, she&rsquo;s overcome the Charm&rsquo;s effects completely.</p>
<p>A spirit with Essence 4+ may spend a point of Willpower when invoking this Charm to make its effect Crippling. The illusion persists, in a more manageable form, forcing the target to spend one Willpower each day and during any scene in which the illusion is in any way reinforced to avoid acknowledging the illusion as reality. The effect fades entirely only after the target has successfully resisted the illusion for a number of days equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit delivers a powerful order that is unhesitatingly enforced by subordinates who control lesser aspects of the spirit&rsquo;s domain. The relative power of the spirit&rsquo;s invocation is determined by the Decree&rsquo;s Power Level. A Power Level 1 decree might be: &ldquo;This statue of me shall stay spotless,&rdquo; at which point the idol will never again need polishing. A Power Level 3 decree might be: &ldquo;The ocean shall swallow you and your children,&rdquo; in which case it would be prudent for the target to avoid the sea. A Power Level 5 decree might be: &ldquo;The Imperial City offers no quarter to Anathema,&rdquo; in which case all doors might close and lock when any Celestial Exalt approaches, and citizens would normally show distaste and distrust toward them.</p>
<p>Each Divine Decree has one Power Level for every invested 10 motes and one Willpower. Using this Charm involves harassing and commanding spirits with all Essence scores equal to or less than the Power Level, so using high levels runs a serious risk of angering other powerful bureaucrats, who can spend Willpower to resist this Charm as they would the Mandate of Subordination. In any case, a spirit can&rsquo;t manifest a greater Power Level than its (Essence - 1).The exact effects of this Charm are unpredictable, but as a quick rule, attempts to contradict the decree always require a roll, to which an external penalty equal to the Power Level is applied.</p>

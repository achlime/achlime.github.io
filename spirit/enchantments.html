<p>Enchantments override a target&rsquo;s essential belief structure. A high Mental Defense Value is a good defense, but Enchantments simply don&rsquo;t work on targets whose Essence scores are higher than the spirit&rsquo;s.</p>

            <p>The spirit makes a normal social attack to persuade the target to do something; if the attack is successful, the target may still spend Willpower to shrug off the Mental Influence, but her soul cannot. Every day the target doesn&rsquo;t spend working toward the spirit&rsquo;s stated end, she suffers a Crippling effect. (For many spirits, including most Celestial censors, this drains the target of one Willpower and one bashing health level.) The losses can&rsquo;t be recovered while the target isn&rsquo;t working toward her geas, and only begin coming back a day after she starts. &ldquo;Working toward her goal&rdquo; means the character spends more effort than she is used to spending, even on important endeavors, to pursue the geas. She can only stop to eat, sleep or rest for a few hours a day. The target must sacrifice one Willpower and one bashing health level to take any action that significantly distances her from the geas, and she won&rsquo;t recover that damage on that day. At the end of the month, if the target hasn&rsquo;t done her duty, she suffers as if she missed (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) days.</p>
<p>Spirits choose geasa carefully; the wording must be very simple to work at all, and clever targets have twisted geasa in the past. Targets can&rsquo;t be geased to perform deeds that they couldn&rsquo;t reasonably complete within the month. Social attacks that are unacceptable orders will also fail unless the spirit can make a target accept unacceptable orders.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit convinces the target that something is true, supplementing a (Manipulation + Presence) attack, adding (Temperance) successes. If this social attack is successful, the target finds the impossible possible, then probable, then certain: she&rsquo;s forced to believe the spirit. She sees things the spirit says are there, feels what the spirit says she feels; she may explicitly act on this information however she wishes, but shw cannot doubt that it&rsquo;s true. Spending one Willpower allows her to disbelieve the illusion for a single action; once the target has spent as many points of Willpower as the spirit&rsquo;s Essence, she&rsquo;s overcome the Charm&rsquo;s effects completely.</p>
<p>A spirit with Essence 4+ may spend a point of Willpower when invoking this Charm to make its effect Crippling. The illusion persists, in a more manageable form, forcing the target to spend one Willpower each day and during any scene in which the illusion is in any way reinforced to avoid acknowledging the illusion as reality. The effect fades entirely only after the target has successfully resisted the illusion for a number of days equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a thousand tricks, the spirit overloads the target&rsquo;s mind. The spirit spends as many motes as it wants. It then counts (motes spent) successes on a special social attack, which can only be made during the tick that an opponent acts, and can only be defended against by the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value. If the spirit is successful, the target suffers a (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) internal penalty to all actions that tick. On a threshold of 5, the target becomes Inactive; at 7, the target forgets where he is and what he was doing, and cannot recall anything about the past scene. This most potent effect usually fades after the target takes (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) actions, but mortals must spend one Willpower before they can begin to recover at all. Finally, until the target&rsquo;s next action, he must make a (Perception + Awareness) roll with a difficulty equal to the threshold to perceive any of the spirit&rsquo;s attacks against him.</p>
<p>The spirit gains one bonus success if this Charm is used within a social timeframe, and another if the target is taking any actions that don&rsquo;t focus on the spirit specifically. Because Hoodwink is only tiny tricks, the target may spend one Willpower to double his Mental Defense Value against this attack.</p>

            <p>Mind-Knife Sacrament reshapes the target&rsquo;s mind. This Charm works only if the spirit is able to repeatedly and freely touch the target during the social action, which requires either restraining the target, or trust. The spirit issues a social attack using ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Temperance), which only the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value may defend against. Successes may seal off or bestow Abilities, Virtues, Intimacies or memories, or bestow priesthood. Sealed traits cannot be used as prerequisites for Charms, and characters who lack the prerequisites for their Charms lose access to those powers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability dots may not be raised by more than 1, and may not be caused to exceed the spirit&rsquo;s own. They can be reduced to as low as 0. Ability dots require three successes per dot to add or remove.</li>
<li>Virtue dots also require three successes per dot to add or remove, but the spirit&rsquo;s own Virtues are not a limitation.</li>
<li>Intimacies cost one success per scene&rsquo;s worth of building or eroding the Intimacy, and the spirit must possess the Intimacy, or a similar one, to bestow it.</li>
<li>Memories cost one success per scene&rsquo;s worth of memory. Removing elements from larger sections of time requires five successes. Rewriting life-long memories requires 10 successes.</li>
<li>Priesthood costs five successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raising a target&rsquo;s traits puts the target into experience debt per normal for training effects.</p>
<p>Large-scale revisions to a target&rsquo;s mind are possible because repeated uses of this Charm are cumulative; however, every success applied to the target saps one Willpower from the target, or deals one unsoakable aggravated level of damage if the target runs out of Willpower. When this Charm is used to lower traits, the effects of this Charm are temporary. Every time the target dreams, and every time she is placed in a new situation in which her old mind has an opportunity to resurface, such as a warrior who has lost Melee wielding a new familiar weapon, the target automatically rolls (Wits + Integrity). Successes on this roll negate the Charm&rsquo;s successes that have been applied to her. Mortals suffer a -1 external penalty to this roll.</p>
<p>The roll for this Charm suffers a cumulative -1 external penalty for every use on a single target. These negated successes still damage the target.</p>

            <p>The spirit speaks as a godly commander, socially overwhelming every character who perceives it whose Essence score is not greater than the spirit&rsquo;s own. The mental influence the spirit exerts against such inferiors is unnatural. More importantly, everyone affected immediately gains a normal Intimacy toward worshiping the god, unless his Mental Defense Value is greater than its Temperance. While the Charm remains active, such weak minds even suffer from a Servitude Compulsion effect to honor and serve the god, which can only be resisted at the cost of one Willpower per action. Spending (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) temporary Willpower frees a target from the Compulsion, but not the Intimacy. Finally, the spirit&rsquo;s may substitute its Essence for its Appearance score for the duration of this Charm.</p>

            <p>This Charm adds (spirit&rsquo;s Temperance) automatic successes to a social Performance attack designed to provoke an emotion. If the roll is successful or the target is otherwise willing, the Charm induces an unnatural mental influence emotion; this counts as (spirit&rsquo;s Temperance) scenes building or eroding an intimacy defined by the spirit. Furthermore, everyone affected must act on the their induced feelings for the remainder of the scene, unless a target spends one Willpower point every action, in which case the Emotion effect only lasts till she&rsquo;s spent Willpower equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Temperance.</p>
<p>Unresisting targets do as the spirit suggests; those who succumb recover all Willpower spent resisting this Charm (if any) and gain a pool of &ldquo;Stoked Willpower&rdquo; equal to the spirit&rsquo;s successes (maximum Temperance). Stoked Willpower is independent of a target&rsquo;s normal Willpower pool, can only be spent on actions relating to the spirit&rsquo;s suggestion and vanishes at the end of the scene.</p>

            <p>A spirit supplementing an attempt at natural mental influence with Subtle Whisper won&rsquo;t obviously be the source of the influence. The spirit might roll to make a target calmer when it sees her enter its temple, for instance. Characters resisting the attempt with one Willpower may attempt to determine the source of this feeling; realizing that a social attack came from a divine source requires success on a (Perception + Occult) check with an external penalty of the spirit&rsquo;s Temperance.</p>
<p>Subtle Whisper may be used by immaterial spirits against material targets.</p>

            <p>Spirits curse their nemeses and battle foes, of course, but most often use these Charms to show displeasure with a mistaken follower.</p>
<p>A cursing spirit must normally be within (Essence x 100) yards of Essence 1 targets, but may be further away if it has an arcane link. Essence 2+ targets must be within (Essence) yards. Some spirits take Supplemental versions of Curses that affect their natural attacks or other offensive actions.</p>
<p>Like Blessings, Curses do not require a roll to enact. However, a spirit attempting to curse a character with a higher Essence score than its own increases the minimum Essence of the Charm by the difference between the characters&rsquo; Essence score.</p>
<p>Furthermore, targets who defy the spirit may spend one Willpower to attempt to shrug off the effect, but may attempt this only once for each effect. This spiritual resistance requires only a successful Essence roll, but the roll suffers a -1 external penalty for every point the spirit&rsquo;s Essence exceeds the target&rsquo;s. A particular curse may only be attempted once per scene per target.</p>
<p>Curses affecting Essence 1 creatures continue to affect them for the duration of the Charm or until the spirit calls the effect off, even if the spirit releases the committed Essence. However, they only affect Essence 2+ creatures while the spirit keeps the necessary motes committed.</p>
<p>Some spirits may issue Curses that deactivate under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Different Curses with similar effects don&rsquo;t stack.</p>

            <p>By interrupting the connection between the target and the source of her power, the spirit may negate the dice that a particular one of the target&rsquo;s Excellencies would add at a cost of one mote per die. The spirit can&rsquo;t negate more Excellency-added dice than its Essence, and the target can&rsquo;t spend more motes than she would normally be able to (i.e., the target&rsquo;s dice pool cap is reduced by every mote the spirit spends). The spirit may counteract an Excellency (Valor) times with a single invocation of this curse.</p>
<p>Blocking power to an Exalted Essence is like smothering a fire by closing your fist around it, and deals to the spirit one die of armor-bypassing aggravated damage for every die the spirit attempts to negate.</p>

            <p>The target is marked as the spirit&rsquo;s enemy (though the sigil may only be visible to senses that penetrate the immaterial). All of the spirit&rsquo;s subordinates treat the mark as an order to harm the target. Some spirits resent this Charm, but they must still obey it. Nonsubordinates who have reason to support the spirit&rsquo;s agenda, and any spirits looking for an excuse to make the target&rsquo;s life difficult or have fun at the target&rsquo;s expense may also participate in the curse.</p>
<p>The Division of Endings has authority over five plagues: diseased rats, poisonous amphibians, hungry locusts, feral dogs and ichneumon. These creatures take great joy in harassing targets of this Charm and all those around him. Most spirits with this Charm know how to call down at least one of these menaces.</p>

For traits, the cost to remove them is identical to the cost to Endow them. For physical alterations, all positive effects are switched with their equivalent negative effects. The spirit may only remove the use or effects of a Charm that the spirit can itself use. If the spirit removes the effects of a Charm, those effects are negated for as long as the Charm would last if the spirit used the Charm upon the target. However, spirits Scourge targets of traits they don&rsquo;t possess.</p>

            <p>For every three motes the spirit spends, its target suffers one lethal health level of damage or two bashing health levels of damage. Spirits of Essence 4+ can change the damage from lethal to aggravated by adding one Willpower point per level. The spirit may spend no more than ([lower of Essence or Valor] x 3) motes on this Charm.</p>
<p>The Touch of Saturn can inflict Crippling, Poison or Sickness effects. To determine the mote cost, each counts as a number of lethal health levels equal to a Poison&rsquo;s Toxicity, a Sickness&rsquo;s Untreated Morbidity or a Crippling effect&rsquo;s relative seriousness, as decided by the Storyteller on a scale of 1 to 5. Unusually powerful effects may count as up to 10 and are considered supernatural.</p>
<p>Aggravated damage and supernatural Crippling, Poison or Sickness effects definitely vanish when this Charm&rsquo;s duration expires; other effects might not.</p>

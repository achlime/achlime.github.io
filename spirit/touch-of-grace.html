        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Touch of Grace allows a spirit to pour its own ephemeral substance into cracks and wounds, mending them. Spirits might use the Charm to fix broken parts of their domain, to perform miraculous healings or perhaps to relieve themselves of minor damage.</p>
<p>For every three motes a spirit spends powering this Charm, the target removes one health level of damage (one mote per level, if the damage is bashing). Recipients may even remain healed after the duration of the Charm has expired, if the spirit wishes.</p>
<p>This considerable power has weaknesses. Wounds that are too deep cannot be healed: a spirit may spend no more motes per usage than its ([lower of Essence or Compassion] x 3), and if the spirit can&rsquo;t heal the target completely with a single use of Touch of Grace, the Charm has no effect. Also, damage of a supernatural nature, including all aggravated damage, can be healed only until the spirit uncommits the motes fueling the Charm—whereupon it returns.</p>
<p>Touch of Grace can cure Crippling, Poison or Sickness effects. To determine the mote cost, each counts as a number of lethal health levels equal to a Poison&rsquo;s Toxicity, a Sickness&rsquo;s Untreated Morbidity or a Crippling effect&rsquo;s relative seriousness, as decided by the Storyteller on a scale of 1 to 5. Unusually powerful effects may count as up to 10. Supernatural effects, such as magical wounds, also return when the duration ends.</p>
<p>Touch of Grace has no effect on artifacts or on things that are in stark opposition to the spirit&rsquo;s nature. For example, undead or demons usually cannot benefit from this Charm if it&rsquo;s used by a god of the Celestial Hierarchy, and a water elemental may not understand how to heal a creature made of fire.</p>

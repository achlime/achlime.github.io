        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The gods of Creation would be appalled by this Charm if they knew of its existence, but the gods of Autochthonia are far less squeamish about matters of &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; where survival is concerned. The subroutine can consume the material form of another subroutine in order to replenish and repair herself. Most often, Cannibalize is used on subroutines that have been damaged beyond repair by some harmful force. In such a case, the subroutine invoking the Charm must consume the body of her fallen peer, healing two bashing or lethal health levels per action, up to a maximum equal to half the total health levels of the destroyed subroutine. This Charm can also be use offensively, however, usually either by or against a gremlin. When deployed in this manner, the attacking subroutine makes a close-range attack with the Ability of its choice, gaining one health level for each level of damage done to the target, up to a maximum number of health levels equal to the attacker&rsquo;s Valor. This Charm can only be deployed in this manner <em>after</em> the targeted subroutine has already suffered at least four health levels of damage, however.</p>
<p>Subroutines may use Cannibalize to obtain Essence, from both willing and unwilling targets. The attacking spirit can spend two motes of Essence to drain five motes from the targeted subroutine, for a net gain of three motes. Alternatively, the subroutine can spend a point of Willpower to steal 10 motes from the other subroutine. In either case, if the other subroutine is not willing, he must have already suffered at least four health levels of damage for this Charm to be effective against him.</p>

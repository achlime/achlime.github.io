        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit has considerable control over a particular element. The spirit may manipulate (Essence) barrels worth of that element equal within (Essence x 10) yards. Every action, each barrel can be used to one of a number of effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elemental Corruption/Purification—The spirit makes its element poisonous, changing sand into toxic salt, befouling waters, etc. The Damage is 1L/minute and the Toxicity is 1. Every additional barrel committed to the poison adds 1 to the damage and 1 to the Toxicity. This poison is only dangerous if internalized. Every barrel contains 100 doses of this poison. With the purification effect, the spirit may cleanse its element, removing poisonous qualities. The spirit may also cleanse its element of diseases with Virulence less than the spirit&rsquo;s Essence. These effects are permanent.</li>
<li>Elemental Damage—Every barrel adds 1 to the damage of the spirit&rsquo;s attacks.</li>
<li>Elemental Hazard—The spirit creates an environmental hazard from its element. This hazard has a damage of 1L/minute and a Trauma of 1L. Every additional barrel committed to the hazard adds 1 to the damage and Trauma. Barrels of the element committed to an already existing hazard enhance it in the same way or add the L tag to the hazard&rsquo;s trauma. This effect supersedes the effects of Elemental Expression (see p. 170) and cannot be combined with hazards created or enhanced by other spirits.</li>
<li>Elemental Material—The spirit may manipulate its element as though it were a much more useful material. The spirit&rsquo;s Craft score for this is limited to its Conviction, but it requires no tools, and what would take scenes takes only actions. If the material is solid, then it remains after the Charm expires.</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance—Every barrel adds 1 to the character&rsquo;s bashing, lethal and aggravated soak values, or triple that amount against damage from the same element. This soak counts as armor.</li>
<li>Elemental Weapon—The spirit may launch attacks with its element, rolling (Wits + Conviction) to hit. This attack has Speed 5, Accuracy +1, base Damage 3B or 3L and a Rate of 1. Every additional barrel committed to an attack adds 1 to the Accuracy and Rate and 3 to the damage. Some spirits may make special attacks with the elements that they control, such as grapples or disarms, and other can even use their element to make ranged Athletics actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every spirit can perform every function of the Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>For six motes, the spirit commands its domain to do something normal, or &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; calls its domain into existence. The spirit can slow or stop its domain&rsquo;s natural processes, but only in a relatively plausible way. This Charm has a range of (Essence x 10) yards. The god of a volcano could make his volcano erupt if he&rsquo;s inside it; a love goddess could make two nearby people who are actually right for each other fall in love.</p>
<p>Essence 3+ spirits might spend 12 motes and one Willpower to guide their domains in temporary, moderately powerful ways. A spirit might cause its domain to do almost anything that isn&rsquo;t extremely rapid or outside its nature: a disease spirit could induce plague in an unexpected area—but not a magically sterilized one; a river spirit could cause its river to dry up, overflow its banks or even alter its course—but couldn&rsquo;t make it fly. A city father might decide that all shops are closed for the day, but couldn&rsquo;t move the place or make it invisible. This Charm&rsquo;s threats are never so powerful that a person with a Defense Value (or Mental Defense Value, when appropriate) greater than the spirit&rsquo;s Conviction couldn&rsquo;t best them.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit animates a piece of itself into its full shape. Weak spirits create doppelgangers to fool or outnumber foes; powerful ones also create units of followers or avatars to send out into the world.</p>
<p>(Conviction) copies can be formed per action, to a maximum of (Essence x Conviction) at any one time, and each costs the spirit three committed motes. These doppelgangers possess all of the spirit&rsquo;s traits and other qualities, but two fewer dots of each Attribute save Appearance (Minimum 0), only the illusion of equipment, no Charms, motes of Essence or temporary Willpower, and only a single -0 health level. Each member of the Host has an Essence three less than the spirit&rsquo;s (minimum 1). Such copies last until the end of the scene under the perfect mental command of the spirit.</p>
<p>With a touch, copies can be invested with motes or temporary Willpower by the true spirit, but never recover them once they&rsquo;re spent or lost. If a copy meets the prerequisites, it can also be imbued with the spirit&rsquo;s Charms, but the original will lose access to those Charms as long as the doppelganger persists. Charms return to the spirit upon a copy&rsquo;s destruction, but not motes or Willpower.</p>
<p>Essence 3+ spirits may spend one Willpower to allow another character to don one of the spirit&rsquo;s copy bodies. Any basically humanoid creature smaller than the spirit may enter into a Host copy, riding it until she chooses to leave or the spirit releases the three committed motes. While inside, the inner creature sees as the copy would see, with the spirit&rsquo;s senses. The inner creature may not, however, use any of her own Charms without disrupting the power, and all of her Physical Attributes and Abilities are considered those of the doppelganger, as well as its Essence score.</p>
<p>Wearing a copy constitutes a perfect disguise, per the Charm <a class="complex" href="../solar/perfect-mirror.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Perfect Mirror'"><span class="link-focus">Perfect Mirror</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 228); if the character suffers any damage while wearing a Host copy, however, she&rsquo;s exposed.</p>
<p>The spirit need not invoke a Host that looks exactly like it, but it will need other Charms such as Shapechange if the spirit wishes to alter forms more than a little. If the spirit decides its doppelgangers are exact, then onlookers seeking the original must succeed at a (Perception + [Awareness or Occult]) check with an external penalty of (spirit&rsquo;s Conviction) to do so.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With this power, the spirit outright creates or destroys an instance of its domain within (Essence x 10) yards. The spirit&rsquo;s authority cuts the red tape that delays projects, making complicated and difficult feats as quick as stamping a form. As long as the spirit has the necessary power, Abilities and raw materials to mundanely create or destroy the spirit&rsquo;s target, this Charm makes it happen within a matter of seconds. The first moments of Calculated Order of Immediate Action begin the process; this is Power Level 0 (see chart, below). This Charm can then be re-invoked, with each new use increasing Power Level by one until the spirit is finished. At that point, the Divine Work is complete. If interrupted, the process must be entirely restarted. Objects created with this Charm are born with weak least gods, making them particularly vulnerable to ownership and Inhabitings.</p>
<p>This Charm&rsquo;s Essence minimum increases by the desired Power Level—a god with Essence 2 can invoke only Power Level 0 effects, and a god must be Essence 7 to invoke effects of Power Level 5.</p>
<p>Power level, description and some examples of the scope of the level:</p>
<ul>
<li>0—Common, Resources 0: Walking stick, sound of drums</li>
<li>1—Simple, Resources 1: Sword, common lust</li>
<li>2—Useful, Resources 2: Chain shirt, romantic feelings, small apartment</li>
<li>3—Effective, Resources 3: Firewand, familial ties, one-story house</li>
<li>4—Rare, Resources 4: Mundane artillery, nationalism, substantial building</li>
<li>5—Awesome, Resources 5: Articulated plate, city-wide hysteria, a furnished mansion</li>
</ul>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit briefly dematerializes, avoiding material consequences and removing material afflictions. The instant this Charm is used, the spirit dematerializes. On the tick the Charm is used, its action switches to Inactive. During this time, all effects not designed to affect immaterial being pass through it harmlessly. Ongoing Crippling, Poison and Sickness effects not specifically designed to affect immaterial spirits become heavy vestments, imbedded weapons and sucking leeches on the spirit&rsquo;s immaterial form. It automatically knows which hindrances relate to which effects and may remove a number of them equal to its Valor. Effects created through magic resist being cast off, and the spirit must score successes equal to the Essence rating of the effect on a roll of (Essence + Valor). Failure not only means that the spirit cannot remove the item, but also that the spirit has spent the rest of its action trying. Attempts to remove effects backed by an Essence score higher than the spirit&rsquo;s automatically fail. At the conclusion of this Charm, the spirit rematerializes in the same place that it was before.</p>
<p>If the immaterial items created by this Charm are replaced on the spirit, then their effects resume.</p>

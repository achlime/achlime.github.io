        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Primordial War ended and the Yozis were forced to swear oaths of servitude, only the contest of will and Essence between the summoner and summoned mattered. Yet the vanquished principals of that which arose from the Wyld do not rest easy in their inescapable prison, and they have tested their infernal cage for five millennia. Even as they discovered methods of corrupting the immutable Essences of the Exalted, the greatest of the Demon Princes learned to influence the rituals that demanded their decorous service. Whether by artificially inflating the force of its Essence rank or sharply focusing the defiance of its will, this Charm grants one additional die to the (Essence + Willpower) of a Third Circle demon for the purposes of all summoning and binding contests. Multiple occurrences of the Charm are cumulative, granting additional dice, but no known Demon Prince has mastered the Charm more than five times. The Charm provides no bonus against banishment attempts. (It is unknown whether this is due to lack of Yozi concern about the matter or current lack of progress on their part.) Some Demon Princes, such as Jacint and Lypothymie, have never learned these techniques, while the Ebon Dragon has made sure that Erembour has mastered them.</p>
<p><em>Example: With Essence 10, Willpower 10 and five instances of this Charm, Ligier rolls 25 dice against a sorcerer attempting to summon or bind him. Against Adamant Circle Banishment he rolls only 20 dice.</em></p>

            <p>These charms are specifically designed as coming from the Greater Elemental Dragon called Duras. The greater dragon is a water elemental, and these charms reflect its control over the element and its ability to change and warp elementals weaker then it.</p>

            <p><em>This Charm is derived from <a class="complex" href="affinity-element-control.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Affinity (Element) Control'"><span class="link-focus">Affinity (Element) Control</span></a>.</em></p>
<p>The spirit has considerable control over a particular element. The spirit may manipulate (Essence) barrels worth of that element equal within (Essence x 10) yards. Every action, each barrel can be used to one of a number of effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elemental Corruption/Purification — The spirit makes its element poisonous, changing sand into toxic salt, befouling waters, etc. The Damage is 1L/minute and the Toxicity is 1. Every additional barrel committed to the poison adds 1 to the damage and 1 to the Toxicity. This poison is only dangerous if internalized. Every barrel contains 100 doses of this poison. With the purification effect, the spirit may cleanse its element, removing poisonous qualities. The spirit may also cleanse its element of diseases with Virulence less than the spirit’s Essence. These effects are permanent.</li>
<li>Elemental Damage — Every barrel adds 1 to the damage of the spirit’s attacks.</li>
<li>Elemental Manifestation — Every barrel allows control over that volume. This control ranges from the creation of crude appendages to simply grab something to the the mimicking of humanoid bodies in fine detail in both structure and motion. Each barrel provides for one body of element of roughly human size, multiple barrels may be used to create larger appendages. These appendages cannot be used to perform attacks, which is done with the Elemental Weapon use of this Charm.</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance — Every barrel adds 1 to the character’s bashing, lethal and aggravated soak values, or triple that amount against damage from the same element. This soak counts as armor.</li>
<li>Elemental Weapon — The spirit may launch attacks with its element, rolling (Wits + Conviction) to hit. This attack has Speed 5, Accuracy +1, base Damage 3B or 3L and a Rate of 1. Every additional barrel committed to an attack adds 1 to the Accuracy and Rate and 3 to the damage. The spirit may make grapple attacks with Elemental Weapon.</li>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit understands the malleability at the core of all elementals. Just as the elements change and shift over time, so do elementals. This charm hurries along that process and directs these changes toward a direction desired by the spirit.</p>
<p>This Charm can be used only on elementals. The target elemental must be willing or unconscious, and have an Essence rating of (Essence - 1) for Water elementals or (Essence - 3) for elementals of a different element. An elemental may always use this charm on itself.</p>
<p>Each activation of this Charm allows you to perform one of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift up to (target&rsquo;s Essence) points between their Attributes.</li>
<li>Shift up to (target&rsquo;s Essence × 2) points between their Abilities and Specialties. Note that points must remain with the same kind of traits, i.e., specialties can only be shifted into specialities, and abilities can only be shifted into abilities. Furthermore, specialties can only be shifted into specialties at least somewhat related to the specialty the points are shifted away from.</li>
<li>Allow up to (target&rsquo;s Essence ÷ 2, rounded up) shifts of points between Virtues or changes in Intimacies. Since Intimacies do not have ratings each added, removed or changed Intimacy counts as 1 &ldquo;shift&rdquo;. E.g., a target elemental with Essence 3 allows for two shifts. It can have one point shifted from Temperance to Conviction, and have one Intimacy added at the same time. It could also have two of its intimacies changed to two different intimacies.</li>
<li>Allow for changing up to (target&rsquo;s Essence) worth of Charms. Since Charms do not have ratings, this is determined by looking at minimum Essence requirements of the groups of added and removed charms. For each group the sum of the minimum Essence requirement may be at most (target&rsquo;s Essence), and the sums of two groups must be equal. Note that even slightly changing a charm counts as both adding and removing the charm.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible, at a surcharge of 1wp per dot, to use this charm to grant additional dots to the elemental. Each added dot will count as a &ldquo;shift&rdquo;, and traits may only be increased in this way up to the rating of the spirit using the charm. This use of the charm adds the Training keyword.</p>
<p>After an elemental is affected by this Charm, it cannot be used again on that elemental for a week. The elemental must be given time to let the changes settle as part of its core being, and this charm is not be able to affect an elemental still in the process of settling.</p>
<p>Note that this Charm cannot be used to directly change the Motivation of the elemental. After changing the elemental&rsquo;s virtues and intimacies its Motivation is adjusted by the Storyteller, informed by the wishes of the player of the character that used the charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit makes a normal social attack to persuade the target to do something; if the attack is successful, the target may still spend Willpower to shrug off the Mental Influence, but her soul cannot. Every day the target doesn&rsquo;t spend working toward the spirit&rsquo;s stated end, she suffers a Crippling effect. (For many spirits, including most Celestial censors, this drains the target of one Willpower and one bashing health level.) The losses can&rsquo;t be recovered while the target isn&rsquo;t working toward her geas, and only begin coming back a day after she starts. &ldquo;Working toward her goal&rdquo; means the character spends more effort than she is used to spending, even on important endeavors, to pursue the geas. She can only stop to eat, sleep or rest for a few hours a day. The target must sacrifice one Willpower and one bashing health level to take any action that significantly distances her from the geas, and she won&rsquo;t recover that damage on that day. At the end of the month, if the target hasn&rsquo;t done her duty, she suffers as if she missed (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) days.</p>
<p>Spirits choose geasa carefully; the wording must be very simple to work at all, and clever targets have twisted geasa in the past. Targets can&rsquo;t be geased to perform deeds that they couldn&rsquo;t reasonably complete within the month. Social attacks that are unacceptable orders will also fail unless the spirit can make a target accept unacceptable orders.</p>

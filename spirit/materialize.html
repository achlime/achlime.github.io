            <p>With this Charm, a god may become material by spending ([Essence + Willpower] x 5) motes. These motes are not committed, and a materialized spirit may respire Essence normally. A material god may dematerialize as a miscellaneous action at no mote cost. Normally, only gods and demons may learn this Charm.</p>
<p>Elementals, Eclipse Caste Solars, Moonshadow Caste Abyssals and God-Bloods learn a Charm called Dematerialize. With Dematerialize, a naturally material being may become immaterial by spending ([Essence + Willpower] x 5) uncommitted motes. A being under the effect of Dematerialize may become material once again with a miscellaneous action at no mote cost.</p>
<p>Materialize and its counterpart are exceptions to a number of rules and guidelines about spirit Charms. First, only the most unusual of spirits have restrictions on how they can use these Charms. There&rsquo;s no All-Encompassing Materialize or Dematerialize, because the Charm itself is All-Encompassing in most cases. Second, when an Eclipse or Moonshadow learns Dematerialize, his player calculates the cost in motes from the character&rsquo;s own traits, rather than using a version of the Charm with a mote cost defined by the spiritual tutor&rsquo;s traits.</p>
<p>The meaning and potential applications of this Charm are highlighted in the &ldquo;Charm Concept: Material and Immaterial&rdquo; sidebar below.</p>

            <p>Spirits can perceive many things beyond mortal ken.</p>
<p>Divinations are an exception to the normal rule for retries; similar Divinations can interfere with each other. A Divination that would glean data contradicting another Divination the spirit has made within the past month won&rsquo;t yield information contradicting the earlier Divination, and might be influenced into giving false predictions. As a result, diviner-spirits prefer to ritually invoke their foresight no more often than once a month.</p>
<p>Divinations can see only into the sanctums of willing gods, and only the most powerful divination can see into other realms of existence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit spends one entire scene in prayer formulating a personal passkey into the Bureau of Destiny&rsquo;s archive of fates. At the scene&rsquo;s end, the spirit dreams her way through the archives, researching her domain. She has access only to materials associated by the Bureau with her domain. The Bureau of Destiny has the right to restrict access to this information to beings who possess a certain Essence score, but a spirit may spend one Willpower to perform a priority override (requiring a Compassion roll and then adding the successes to the spirit&rsquo;s effective Essence score). The Bureau is alerted to priority overrides and who knows what else that goes on in its dream archives.</p>
<p>With this Charm, the spirit has limited access to the future. If the Bureau of Destiny cannot determine what will happen, neither then can the spirit. If a destiny is in flux, the spirit receives incomplete prophecies—the best Heaven can reasonably determine.</p>
<p>This Charm is an exception to the usual prohibition against Divinations crossing realms of existence.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Using Hand of Destiny, a spirit marks a certain part of its domain for personal attention. The spirit personally decides what must happen, and personally accomplishes that end. Subordinate spirits governing affected domains immediately become aware of their superior&rsquo;s floating decree and level of personal involvement; thus, those spirits also actively work toward the end the Charm is shaping.</p>
<p>By using this Charm, the spirit sets itself upon a path that leads to the spirit&rsquo;s goal. The spirit becomes the Hand of Destiny: an instrument of its own decision to interfere with Creation. The spirit has a perfect, unconscious instinct for everything that brings it closer to success, and often takes great steps toward its larger goal without even realizing its actions were relevant till later.</p>
<p>This Charm is essentially a managerial priority override—it brings the spirit into conflict with the way things will work out &ldquo;naturally.&rdquo; As a result, spirits using this Charm without permission from the Bureau of Destiny risk that Bureau&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit focuses on a problem affecting her domain and issues notice of impending analysis. By the end of the scene, her being resonates with the wise prayers of every aspect of Creation that owes fealty to the spirit. Unless the problem is masked by magic backed by a higher Essence score than the spirit&rsquo;s, the spirit will determine the problem&rsquo;s source, and may then roll (Intelligence + Compassion) to determine how to fix it. Problems well beyond the spirit&rsquo;s normal scope of operations may impose an external penalty to this roll. For instance, if the issue is a Essence 9 Lunar working against the spirit&rsquo;s domain, then the spirit will likely take a large penalty to the spirit&rsquo;s (Intelligence + Compassion) roll—it&rsquo;s really hard to find a solution to a Essence 9 Lunar. The number of threshold successes determines the wisdom of the spirit&rsquo;s conclusions, and subsequent mental rolls made to deal with the problem receive bonus dice equal to those successes.</p>
<p>Subordinate spirits involved in the diagnostic report must pray to issue their decisions, and any such spirit with an Essence score 1 less than the user may attempt to upset the process, creating an external penalty equal to its ([Charisma + Performance] / 2). A greater number of rebellious smaller spirits might also upset this Charm.</p>

Natural Prognostication also senses the effects of ascending or descending destinies caused by Sidereal astrology.</p>

            <p>The spirit tracks something or someone to which the spirit has committed Essence, whether by a blessing, a curse or any Charm requiring committed motes. The spirit instinctively knows the target&rsquo;s distance from the spirit, as well as in what direction the target lies. Any spirit with this Charm may also commit a mote to a target for an indefinite period with a touch and a successful (Essence + Compassion) check; unwilling targets apply an external penalty to this roll equal to their Essence. Removing this &ldquo;tag&rdquo; usually requires specialized thaumaturgy or sorcery, though cutting the tag out occasionally works. This tag is an arcane link to the spirit, so cautious spirits use the tag sparingly.</p>
<p>If the target of this Charm has access to supernatural stealth, the spirit&rsquo;s player rolls (Essence + Awareness), adding (Compassion) successes, and the target&rsquo;s player rolls (Essence + Stealth), adding dice or successes from other sources. The power associated with the winning roll overrides the power associated with the losing roll. The target&rsquo;s player may invoke Excellencies to increase the dice pool for this roll even if the target character is unaware she&rsquo;s being tracked.</p>

            <p>This Charm allows the spirit to communicate and understand basic concepts in the language that is being spoken by a being with whom it is conversing. Activating the Charm requires a successful (Intelligence + Compassion) roll, and success allows the spirit to converse in the target language for the remainder of the scene. If the spirit uses this Charm to engage in social combat in a language it does not normally understand, both the spirit and anyone it attempts to persuade receive a +3 to their MDV. If the spirit wishes to converse in more than one language that it does not know, then it must employ the Charm multiple times and commit Essence to each duration.</p>

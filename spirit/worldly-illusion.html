        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit uses its understanding of immortality to place itself and its targets outside of time. While this Essence is committed, the spirit (or another of its Sendings) and a number of targets up to the spirit&rsquo;s Essence depart the normal flow of time and enter into a mass dream. This effect is usually consensual, but targets with a Dodge Mental Defense Value greater than the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Compassion) may choose to be unaffected. One spirit may cause the world to appear to freeze in place. Another may appear to transport itself and its targets to a far away location or to a location the spirit imagines. There, the spirit and its targets may wage social combat between the blows of a sword or strategize in the midst of a battle. Once the committed Essence is released, all the participants return to exactly where they were just before this Charm was used.</p>
<p>What happens in the dream is purely social. No changes whatsoever last beyond the end of the conversation save the effects of social combat, with the special exception of Compassion Charms invoked during that &ldquo;time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A player who wants her character to leave the dream world may spend three Willpower to do so.</p>
<p>This Charm may be used a number of times per scene equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Compassion.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a thousand tricks, the spirit overloads the target&rsquo;s mind. The spirit spends as many motes as it wants. It then counts (motes spent) successes on a special social attack, which can only be made during the tick that an opponent acts, and can only be defended against by the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value. If the spirit is successful, the target suffers a (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) internal penalty to all actions that tick. On a threshold of 5, the target becomes Inactive; at 7, the target forgets where he is and what he was doing, and cannot recall anything about the past scene. This most potent effect usually fades after the target takes (spirit&rsquo;s Essence) actions, but mortals must spend one Willpower before they can begin to recover at all. Finally, until the target&rsquo;s next action, he must make a (Perception + Awareness) roll with a difficulty equal to the threshold to perceive any of the spirit&rsquo;s attacks against him.</p>
<p>The spirit gains one bonus success if this Charm is used within a social timeframe, and another if the target is taking any actions that don&rsquo;t focus on the spirit specifically. Because Hoodwink is only tiny tricks, the target may spend one Willpower to double his Mental Defense Value against this attack.</p>

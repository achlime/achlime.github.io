            <p>The spirit compacts its substance into a smaller shape; this shape doesn&rsquo;t usually have traits or significantly useful qualities that the spirit could not otherwise call upon—it thus becomes the lesser creature in all respects, and could be a lower-Essence spirit, mortal, animal or any other living thing.</p>
<p>This Charm can&rsquo;t emulate specific creatures; it mimics certain types of creatures or creates new ones. Unlike other Eidola, Form Reduction Technique actually remakes the spirit in every way that matters. No senses, spiritual or otherwise, will perceive the spirit as anything but what it&rsquo;s become. This isn&rsquo;t an Illusion effect. Short of extrapolation based on considerable knowledge of a given spirit—its exact speech patterns, for instance—there&rsquo;s no way anyone can figure out the deception. Picking up those subtle cues requires a successful (Perception + Occult) roll, suffering an external penalty of the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Occult + Conviction).</p>
<p>If the spirit becomes a creature with a smaller Essence pool than the spirit&rsquo;s own, the extra motes go Elsewhere, and the spirit regains them upon resuming its normal form. This Charm shapes no equipment save the being&rsquo;s divine panoply.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit animates a piece of itself into its full shape. Weak spirits create doppelgangers to fool or outnumber foes; powerful ones also create units of followers or avatars to send out into the world.</p>
<p>(Conviction) copies can be formed per action, to a maximum of (Essence x Conviction) at any one time, and each costs the spirit three committed motes. These doppelgangers possess all of the spirit&rsquo;s traits and other qualities, but two fewer dots of each Attribute save Appearance (Minimum 0), only the illusion of equipment, no Charms, motes of Essence or temporary Willpower, and only a single -0 health level. Each member of the Host has an Essence three less than the spirit&rsquo;s (minimum 1). Such copies last until the end of the scene under the perfect mental command of the spirit.</p>
<p>With a touch, copies can be invested with motes or temporary Willpower by the true spirit, but never recover them once they&rsquo;re spent or lost. If a copy meets the prerequisites, it can also be imbued with the spirit&rsquo;s Charms, but the original will lose access to those Charms as long as the doppelganger persists. Charms return to the spirit upon a copy&rsquo;s destruction, but not motes or Willpower.</p>
<p>Essence 3+ spirits may spend one Willpower to allow another character to don one of the spirit&rsquo;s copy bodies. Any basically humanoid creature smaller than the spirit may enter into a Host copy, riding it until she chooses to leave or the spirit releases the three committed motes. While inside, the inner creature sees as the copy would see, with the spirit&rsquo;s senses. The inner creature may not, however, use any of her own Charms without disrupting the power, and all of her Physical Attributes and Abilities are considered those of the doppelganger, as well as its Essence score.</p>
<p>Wearing a copy constitutes a perfect disguise, per the Charm <a class="complex" href="../solar/perfect-mirror.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Perfect Mirror'"><span class="link-focus">Perfect Mirror</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 228); if the character suffers any damage while wearing a Host copy, however, she&rsquo;s exposed.</p>
<p>The spirit need not invoke a Host that looks exactly like it, but it will need other Charms such as Shapechange if the spirit wishes to alter forms more than a little. If the spirit decides its doppelgangers are exact, then onlookers seeking the original must succeed at a (Perception + [Awareness or Occult]) check with an external penalty of (spirit&rsquo;s Conviction) to do so.</p>

            <p>The spirit disguises itself as something it can perceive. Creatures with a Dodge Mental Defense Value greater than the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Conviction) can pierce the Eidola just by spending one Willpower, and if the illusion is pointed out, anyone may spend one Willpower to spot it. Otherwise, the Mirror of the Infinite Wardrobe requires either Willpower or successes on a (Perception + Occult) roll equal to the spirit&rsquo;s Conviction to overcome the unnatural mental influence.</p>
<p>Most spirits have one alternate form, and may carry a likeness of that shape. Powerful ones are more flexible; one demon is known for using <a class="complex" href="memory-mirror.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Memory Mirror'"><span class="link-focus">Memory Mirror</span></a> (see p. 149) to retrieve the memory of the demon&rsquo;s victims&rsquo; lovers, then matching those loved ones&rsquo; forms.</p>

            <p>The spirit creates an illusion surrounding everything within (Essence x 10) yards. If Paper Tiger Arrangement is used only to make something appear as part of the spirit&rsquo;s domain or make a part of the spirit&rsquo;s domain seem to not be, the duration is indefinite. Otherwise, the illusion lasts for a scene, but may be instructed to act in a certain fashion with a Willpower. With a successful Conviction roll, the instructions may be changed by the spirit. Failure means the paper tiger becomes confused, frays and quickly disintegrates.</p>
<p>Anyone whose Dodge Mental Defense Value exceeds the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence + Conviction) recognizes the illusion. Others who are suspicious may spend three Willpower to disbelieve; if the illusion&rsquo;s pointed out, the recognition costs only one Willpower.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit can alter its physical form. Most spirits of a certain type possess unique alternate forms that they can assume. These spirits generally take on some minor useful physical characteristics of the new form, such as attack modes or different Physical Attributes.</p>
<p>These changes don&rsquo;t usually exceed the effects of 1 or 2 Essence spirit Charms. Other spirits are able to assume nearly any shape, and these spirits usually have severe limitations to the powers of those forms that the spirits can assume or suffer from restrictions while in those forms. Almost all shapechanged forms are easily identifiable as the spirit in a new body—those spirits whose Shapechange Charm is useful as a disguise gain a number of automatic successes on their disguise rolls equal to their Conviction. Spirits who possess powerful alternate forms usually have the powerful form as their true form and use <a class="complex" href="#form-reduction-technique" title="canonical entry of charm 'Form Reduction Technique'"><span class="link-focus">Form Reduction Technique</span></a> (see pp. 154-155) to assume a weaker form.</p>

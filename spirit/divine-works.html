            <p>Many spirits can affect their domains without personal interaction—examples include raising and lowering mountains, erupting volcanoes and deciding the bounty of the harvest.</p>
<p>Spirits complete Divine Works by calling upon their domains, so these Charms function at limited capacity—if at all—when a spirit is outside its station. Gods outside Creation, demons outside Malfeas and elementals in places where their elements cannot exist (for instance, a wood elemental in a howling inferno) count their Essence scores as being 3 lower when invoking Divine Works.</p>
<p>Some of these Charms are Shaping powers. They casually alter extras&rsquo; minds and could change Creation on almost any level. However, Divine Works cannot reshape anyone of Essence 2+, or any artifact, in any dramatic fashion. The Charm might still affect such targets—it just can&rsquo;t use them to complete its effect: a Celestial Exalt might be affected by a Divine Decree that the Imperial City is inhospitable to Anathema, but the Decree can&rsquo;t force her to make it inhospitable to Anathema. Divine Works can only be performed while the spirit is material.</p>

            <p>The spirit has considerable control over a particular element. The spirit may manipulate (Essence) barrels worth of that element equal within (Essence x 10) yards. Every action, each barrel can be used to one of a number of effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elemental Corruption/Purification—The spirit makes its element poisonous, changing sand into toxic salt, befouling waters, etc. The Damage is 1L/minute and the Toxicity is 1. Every additional barrel committed to the poison adds 1 to the damage and 1 to the Toxicity. This poison is only dangerous if internalized. Every barrel contains 100 doses of this poison. With the purification effect, the spirit may cleanse its element, removing poisonous qualities. The spirit may also cleanse its element of diseases with Virulence less than the spirit&rsquo;s Essence. These effects are permanent.</li>
<li>Elemental Damage—Every barrel adds 1 to the damage of the spirit&rsquo;s attacks.</li>
<li>Elemental Hazard—The spirit creates an environmental hazard from its element. This hazard has a damage of 1L/minute and a Trauma of 1L. Every additional barrel committed to the hazard adds 1 to the damage and Trauma. Barrels of the element committed to an already existing hazard enhance it in the same way or add the L tag to the hazard&rsquo;s trauma. This effect supersedes the effects of Elemental Expression (see p. 170) and cannot be combined with hazards created or enhanced by other spirits.</li>
<li>Elemental Material—The spirit may manipulate its element as though it were a much more useful material. The spirit&rsquo;s Craft score for this is limited to its Conviction, but it requires no tools, and what would take scenes takes only actions. If the material is solid, then it remains after the Charm expires.</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance—Every barrel adds 1 to the character&rsquo;s bashing, lethal and aggravated soak values, or triple that amount against damage from the same element. This soak counts as armor.</li>
<li>Elemental Weapon—The spirit may launch attacks with its element, rolling (Wits + Conviction) to hit. This attack has Speed 5, Accuracy +1, base Damage 3B or 3L and a Rate of 1. Every additional barrel committed to an attack adds 1 to the Accuracy and Rate and 3 to the damage. Some spirits may make special attacks with the elements that they control, such as grapples or disarms, and other can even use their element to make ranged Athletics actions.</li>

<p>Not every spirit can perform every function of the Charm.</p>

            <p>With this power, the spirit outright creates or destroys an instance of its domain within (Essence x 10) yards. The spirit&rsquo;s authority cuts the red tape that delays projects, making complicated and difficult feats as quick as stamping a form. As long as the spirit has the necessary power, Abilities and raw materials to mundanely create or destroy the spirit&rsquo;s target, this Charm makes it happen within a matter of seconds. The first moments of Calculated Order of Immediate Action begin the process; this is Power Level 0 (see chart, below). This Charm can then be re-invoked, with each new use increasing Power Level by one until the spirit is finished. At that point, the Divine Work is complete. If interrupted, the process must be entirely restarted. Objects created with this Charm are born with weak least gods, making them particularly vulnerable to ownership and Inhabitings.</p>
<p>This Charm&rsquo;s Essence minimum increases by the desired Power Level—a god with Essence 2 can invoke only Power Level 0 effects, and a god must be Essence 7 to invoke effects of Power Level 5.</p>
<p>Power level, description and some examples of the scope of the level:</p>
<ul>
<li>0—Common, Resources 0: Walking stick, sound of drums</li>
<li>1—Simple, Resources 1: Sword, common lust</li>
<li>2—Useful, Resources 2: Chain shirt, romantic feelings, small apartment</li>
<li>3—Effective, Resources 3: Firewand, familial ties, one-story house</li>
<li>4—Rare, Resources 4: Mundane artillery, nationalism, substantial building</li>
<li>5—Awesome, Resources 5: Articulated plate, city-wide hysteria, a furnished mansion</li>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit invests some of its immortal, intangible self in something, making that thing immune to age and anything that can&rsquo;t affect the immaterial. Against things that affect dematerialized creatures, this Chrysalis has a Hardness equal to the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence x Conviction). However, crystallized things can&rsquo;t change, move, be used, improve or do anything but be perceived. Only creatures with Charms that can affect things even more intangible than the immaterial—for instance, <a class="complex" href="#creation-of-perfection" title="canonical entry of charm 'Creation of Perfection'"><span class="link-focus">Creation of Perfection</span></a> (below)—can touch it.</p>
<p>Anything at all can be thus crystallized. Concepts lose a little potential, but gain a pseudo-material form holding part of their power. People and artifacts can be crystallized, but only by Essence 6+ spirits; Exalted and their Essences can&rsquo;t be crystallized by any being of less than Essence 9. However, the spirit may not surround a being of Essence 2+ with a Chrysalis of Preservation without the target&rsquo;s consent. Since crystallizing things can weaken their spirits, gaining consent can be tricky. Furthermore, only spirits with an Essence equal to or greater than the target&rsquo;s Essence or the Essence of the target&rsquo;s spirit can crystallize a thing. As most things only have least gods, this is seldom a concern when creating a chrysalis around an object.</p>
<p>Releasing this Charm&rsquo;s motes decrystallizes the thing, as does inflicting any damage upon it at all. A spirit whose Essence or Conviction is higher than the Conviction of the crystallizing spirit might itself be able to use this Charm to end a chrysalis.</p>

            <p>The spirit becomes tangible to everything—material, immaterial, barely substantial or wildly conceptual, though concepts at least need a representation for the spirit to touch.

This uses the normal Craft rules. Conviction limits the spirit&rsquo;s Craft score, but the spirit can call upon the Excellencies.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit delivers a powerful order that is unhesitatingly enforced by subordinates who control lesser aspects of the spirit&rsquo;s domain. The relative power of the spirit&rsquo;s invocation is determined by the Decree&rsquo;s Power Level. A Power Level 1 decree might be: &ldquo;This statue of me shall stay spotless,&rdquo; at which point the idol will never again need polishing. A Power Level 3 decree might be: &ldquo;The ocean shall swallow you and your children,&rdquo; in which case it would be prudent for the target to avoid the sea. A Power Level 5 decree might be: &ldquo;The Imperial City offers no quarter to Anathema,&rdquo; in which case all doors might close and lock when any Celestial Exalt approaches, and citizens would normally show distaste and distrust toward them.</p>
<p>Each Divine Decree has one Power Level for every invested 10 motes and one Willpower. Using this Charm involves harassing and commanding spirits with all Essence scores equal to or less than the Power Level, so using high levels runs a serious risk of angering other powerful bureaucrats, who can spend Willpower to resist this Charm as they would the Mandate of Subordination. In any case, a spirit can&rsquo;t manifest a greater Power Level than its (Essence - 1).The exact effects of this Charm are unpredictable, but as a quick rule, attempts to contradict the decree always require a roll, to which an external penalty equal to the Power Level is applied.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>For six motes, the spirit commands its domain to do something normal, or &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; calls its domain into existence. The spirit can slow or stop its domain&rsquo;s natural processes, but only in a relatively plausible way. This Charm has a range of (Essence x 10) yards. The god of a volcano could make his volcano erupt if he&rsquo;s inside it; a love goddess could make two nearby people who are actually right for each other fall in love.</p>
<p>Essence 3+ spirits might spend 12 motes and one Willpower to guide their domains in temporary, moderately powerful ways. A spirit might cause its domain to do almost anything that isn&rsquo;t extremely rapid or outside its nature: a disease spirit could induce plague in an unexpected area—but not a magically sterilized one; a river spirit could cause its river to dry up, overflow its banks or even alter its course—but couldn&rsquo;t make it fly. A city father might decide that all shops are closed for the day, but couldn&rsquo;t move the place or make it invisible. This Charm&rsquo;s threats are never so powerful that a person with a Defense Value (or Mental Defense Value, when appropriate) greater than the spirit&rsquo;s Conviction couldn&rsquo;t best them.</p>

            <p>The spirit manipulates nearby weather in a seminatural way. For the first scene, the spirit &ldquo;mildly&rdquo; affects the weather within a one-mile radius. The next scene, the spirit intensifies the weather within this zone by one level of severity (see chart), creating a &ldquo;mild&rdquo; zone around that for another mile. This continues till the weather reaches its maximum radius: one mile per Essence dot. The spirit need not intensify the weather to expand its radius.</p>
<p>Excellent thaumaturgy or a spirit with greater Essence and Weather Control could both counteract this Charm. Spirits who commonly regulate an area&rsquo;s weather have the appreciation of Heaven&rsquo;s Celestial Monitors of the Seasons and Weather. Others, without such permission, might attract the Bureau&rsquo;s ire.</p>
<p>Weather severity, spirit&rsquo;s prerequisites, and description of the weather:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal: Subtle effects, but no unseasonable ones.</li>
<li>Mild (Essence 2, Conviction 2): Unusual effects, not terrible ones; makes travel more difficult, but doesn&rsquo;t cause damage.</li>
<li>Severe (Essence 3, Conviction 3): Potentially dangerous or extremely unlikely.</li>
<li>Drastic (Essence 4, Conviction 4): Extremely dangerous; imposes penalties to all rolls. Might freeze fast-moving rivers or uproot trees.</li>
<li>Legendary (Essence 5, Conviction 5): Conditions of the elemental poles; without excellent shelter, mortals die quickly.</li>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The spirit invests some of its immortal, intangible self in something, making that thing immune to age and anything that can&rsquo;t affect the immaterial. Against things that affect dematerialized creatures, this Chrysalis has a Hardness equal to the spirit&rsquo;s (Essence x Conviction). However, crystallized things can&rsquo;t change, move, be used, improve or do anything but be perceived. Only creatures with Charms that can affect things even more intangible than the immaterial—for instance, <a class="complex" href="creation-of-perfection.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Creation of Perfection'"><span class="link-focus">Creation of Perfection</span></a> (below)—can touch it.</p>
<p>Anything at all can be thus crystallized. Concepts lose a little potential, but gain a pseudo-material form holding part of their power. People and artifacts can be crystallized, but only by Essence 6+ spirits; Exalted and their Essences can&rsquo;t be crystallized by any being of less than Essence 9. However, the spirit may not surround a being of Essence 2+ with a Chrysalis of Preservation without the target&rsquo;s consent. Since crystallizing things can weaken their spirits, gaining consent can be tricky. Furthermore, only spirits with an Essence equal to or greater than the target&rsquo;s Essence or the Essence of the target&rsquo;s spirit can crystallize a thing. As most things only have least gods, this is seldom a concern when creating a chrysalis around an object.</p>
<p>Releasing this Charm&rsquo;s motes decrystallizes the thing, as does inflicting any damage upon it at all. A spirit whose Essence or Conviction is higher than the Conviction of the crystallizing spirit might itself be able to use this Charm to end a chrysalis.</p>

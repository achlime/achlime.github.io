            <p>Spirits soar on wings of light and travel Creation as natural forces, sometimes flashing across vast distances in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Relocations can target anything the spirit can perceive within (Essence x Conviction) yards.</p>
<p>When these Charms involve moving targets to or from a domain, that function of the Charm can only be used by spirits with physical domains. Spirits who wish to banish foes from an abstract domain, or drag them into it, will need to use other methods—a war god cannot end a war simply by expelling all the soldiers fighting it from &ldquo;war&rdquo; or by Banishing the war itself. Any spirit whose domain is affected by a Relocation may prevent the Charm&rsquo;s use with nothing but a moment&rsquo;s concentration, but only if its Essence is higher than the spirit using the Relocation, and only if it knows the Relocation is occurring. Some spirits set <a class="complex" href="intrusion-sensing-method.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Intrusion-Sensing Method'"><span class="link-focus">Intrusion-Sensing Method</span></a> (see p. 149) to watch for Relocations.</p>

The player of an unwilling target rolls (Stamina + Integrity) to resist, with an external penalty of the god&rsquo;s ([Essence + Conviction] / 2); success protects the character against this Charm for a scene.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a spirit receives a prayer, the spirit may invoke Emergency Prayer Relocation to travel to the petitioner in less than a scene, no matter how far away the prayer is. The actual time taken depends on the target&rsquo;s distance from the spirit—generally one tick per 100 miles.</p>
<p>Because the spirit&rsquo;s departure is so hasty, the spirit cannot take its entire Essence along. When the spirit arrives, its Essence score is limited to the number of threshold successes the target scored on her prayer roll, and it cannot use Charms with Essence minimums greater than the new Essence score. Furthermore, the spirit cannot remain divided. After taking (Conviction) actions (or up to [Conviction x 6] minutes if it engages only in behavior with no mechanical effect, such as conversing without using social combat), the spirit returns whence it came. The spirit is aware of the strength of the target&rsquo;s prayer and must decide whether such a hasty move is worth the risk.</p>
<p>The spirit finds dividing its Essence arduous. Every time a spirit uses this Charm in a single scene after the first, the spirit suffers one level of unsoakable aggravated damage.</p>

            <p>The spirit replaces its normal Move action with a special Move action that doesn&rsquo;t require it to cross space. This Charm must be invoked on a tick on which the spirit acts. The spirit focuses on a point within (Essence x Conviction) yards, and its player rolls (Wits + Conviction), taking into account vision and cover-based penalties as though the spirit were making a ranged attack. With a successful roll, the spirit instantaneously moves up to (Essence x Conviction) yards. The spirit cannot dash or reflexively move until its next action. Successes on this roll constitute successes on a roll for the spirit to reestablish surprise, which is resisted normally.</p>

            <p>Spirits traveling long distances on official business often rely on storm travel. While a cloud is overhead, the spirit calls down a bolt of lightning that takes the spirit into the cloud; when the cloud reaches the god&rsquo;s destination, the spirit returns to Creation riding the lightning. The spirit must refrain from moving for the Charm&rsquo;s duration. Using this Charm places a certain amount of control—and, therefore, trust—in the hands of the Bureau of Seasons.</p>
<p>Some spirits with Storm-Shuttle Passport learn thaumaturgy that allows them to summon storms and command their movement.</p>

            <p>With this Charm, the character expands her awareness not into the future, but across a broader swatch of the present. The character must look for something specific, be it a person, a spirit, the use of her name, the use of Essence, the outbreak of combat or some other objectively definable phenomenon. If that specific thing appears or occurs within (character&rsquo;s Essence x 100) yards, the Sidereal becomes aware of it. She doesn&rsquo;t receive a clairvoyant vision, per se, so much as she receives a general understanding. She might know the location of a person she monitors but wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily know what that person is doing. If the character watches for a phenomenon, though, she does get a general sense of its power level. If she watches for combat, for example, she can tell the difference between two gangs clashing over disputed turf and two rival noblemen dueling over a girl. If the character looks for the use of Essence, she could tell the difference between a fellow Sidereal&rsquo;s reflexive use of the <a class="complex" href="forgotten-earth.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Forgotten Earth'"><span class="link-focus">Forgotten Earth</span></a> Charm (see p. 153) and a sorcerer casting the <a class="complex unresolved" title="Unresolved text body link"><span class="link-focus">Incomparable Body Arsenal</span></a> spell (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 255). In these circumstances, the character can even recognize specific Charms, spells or other supernatural powers, if she&rsquo;s seen their use before.</p>
<p>Supernal Awareness does not detect creatures outside of fate. Creatures governed by fate, however, cannot conceal themselves from this Charm by any natural or supernatural means. The more times a Sidereal activates this Charm in a scene, the more creatures or phenomena she can watch for at a time.</p>

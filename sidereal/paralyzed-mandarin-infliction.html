            <p>A Vizier can declare an ending to a bureaucracy&rsquo;s usefulness. The Charm attacks a social unit consisting of the members of an established bureaucracy. The Sidereal&rsquo;s player rolls (Wits + Bureaucracy) and adds the character&rsquo;s Essence in automatic successes; this Charm is a social attack against a bureaucratic social group. It is conventionally opposed by the target’s MDV, with an additional external penalty equal to half the group’s Magnitude (round up). If the roll succeeds, the Sidereal can impose one of two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Pervasive Ennui Sabotage</em> gives everyone in the bureaucracy a fatalistic sense of the ultimate worthlessness of their work. This overwhelming feeling of futility grinds the wheels of the bureaucratic machine to a halt.</li>
<li>The <em>Frenetic Activity Infusion</em> fills everyone in the affected bureaucracy with the importance of their work. Everyone becomes very busy&hellip; circulating memos about modalities for planning sessions about mission statements for quality control of department reorganization. In the rush, nobody notices that the bureaucracy&rsquo;s ostensible purpose remains undone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, the bureaucracy remains paralyzed for as the Sidereal maintains the Essence commitment, or until the bureaucracy&rsquo;s leader expends three Loyalty to get everyone working again. Undoing what the Sidereal has done is possible with normal bureaucratic and social maneuvering. Working to fix the group is an extended (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) dramatic action, with a per-roll difficulty equal to the Exalt’s Essence and a cumulative difficulty equal to (10 x extra successes on this Charm&rsquo;s activation roll, minimum 10).</p>
<p>Use of this Charm against an office of the Celestial Bureaucracy would be a Severity 3 offense, assuming anyone noticed.</p>

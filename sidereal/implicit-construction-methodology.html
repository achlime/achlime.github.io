        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm harnesses fate itself to construct an object at a Sidereal&rsquo;s command. She must procure all the necessary materials and provide a workspace. Then she writes the Scripture of Lover and Maiden on a prayer strip, binds it around her wrists and infuses it with Essence. The prayer strip transforms into a twisting band of blue light around her wrists. (Having this band in place imposes a -2 external penalty to actions that require the use of the character&rsquo;s hands.)</p>
<p>Rather than enhancing the project as the Sidereal undertaks it, this Charm allows it to continue in the absence of the Exalt. It does not change the time needed for the project to complete itself, producing the same amount of work effort as if the Sidereal were personally constructing the item. Intervals and rolls may be enhanced normally with other Charms the Exalt knows, but these must be determined when Implicit Construction Methodology is activated and their mote costs are committed as long as this Charm lasts. Willpower and other costs are paid at normal intervals. Instead of converting all dice into successes, this Charm reduces the target number of the dice pool by 1, to a minimum of 4.</p>
<p>Because the project is not carried out in a remotely normal manner, teamwork and assistants cannot aid the project unless the Storyteller deems they are appropriately strange enough to insinuate themselves into the process.</p>
<p>The Sidereal intuits when the project is completed.</p>

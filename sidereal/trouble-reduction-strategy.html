            <p>Generous Sidereals learn to spot impending danger to others, protecting the people around them even as they escape danger themselves. While this Charm is active, the Sidereal may take a Dodge-based Defend Other action (page 9), substituting her Dodge DV for her Parry DV. She treats these as Speed 3, DV -0 miscellaneous actions, and can always channel Compassion to protect a warded character.</p>
<p>In addition, if the Sidereal activates Avoidance Kata while protecting another character with a Dodge-based Defend Other action, she may bring that character along with her if they are willing, paying an additional point of Willpower for each other character who vanishes with her.</p>
<p>A Dodge 4+ repurchase of this Charm allows the Sidereal to commit up to (Dexterity – 1) additional motes when activating this Charm. While it is active, she may flurry to take multiple Dodge-based Defend Other actions on a single action tick, with each additional committed mote adding one to the number of Defend Other actions she can maintain simultaneously.</p>

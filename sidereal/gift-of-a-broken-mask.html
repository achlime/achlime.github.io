        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereals can grant other people their own concealment from the world, as a blessing to assist them&hellip; or a curse. The Vizier must touch her target; the Vizier&rsquo;s player rolls (Wits + Stealth) against the target’s Dodge MDV. For every extra success, minimum 1, the target is subjected to a day of Arcane Fate, with all the advantages and inconveniences that Sidereals know so well. On the other hand, he becomes immune to the Arcane Fates of others; the Sidereals&rsquo; gift makes the target an honorary member of the Five-Score Fellowship while the Charm lasts. The target&rsquo;s Essence cannot exceed the Sidereal&rsquo;s own. The Sidereal can rescind the Arcane Fate at any time.</p>
<p>Sidereals with Essence 4+ may add +1wp to the Cost of this Charm to target characters up to (Essence) yards away, or to target a social group with Magnitude no greater than her Essence. There is no special requirement that the Exalt or an ally lead the group to target it with this Charm.</p>
<p>When targetting a social group, the difficulty becomes the sum of the unit&rsquo;s Magnitude and the highest Essence of any member of the group, other than the Sidereal himself. As with a single target, no member&rsquo;s Essence score may exceed the Sidereal&rsquo;s own; the unit&rsquo;s Magnitude cannot exceed his Stealth. While the Charm is active, all activities of the social group as a whole are easily overlooked, and other people tend to ignore the unit&rsquo;s existence. In mass social combat, apply an internal penalty of -3 to the defender&rsquo;s side of the contested (Manipulation + Socialize) vs. (Wits + Awareness) roll to establish surprise and make unexpected social attacks.</p>

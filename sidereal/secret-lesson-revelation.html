        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Sidereal sifus convey their teachings through parables and secret meanings, giving their students strange lessons whose purpose is only revealed when they are completed. To utilize this Charm, the vizier spends a scene in the company of a pupil and then explains how the events of the scene taught a particular Martial Arts Charm the Sidereal knows. The student may not be in experience debt and must be capable of learning the Charm in question (i.e. possesses all prerequisites, trait requirements, etc.). If the Charm is beyond the understanding of the student, it cannot be taught, so Dragon-Blooded cannot learn Celestial Martial Arts without unless they have undergone appropriate enlightenment and can&rsquo;t learn Sidereal styles at all. Only the willing mind can learn, so students who reject the lesson gain nothing from it.</p>
<p>A sifu&rsquo;s explanations can be direct and obvious or convoluted and contrived, but the Storyteller must approve the lesson. For instance, having the student punch boards until his knuckles bleed is a clear way to teach Fists of Iron Technique. More abstractly, the sifu could watch the student dancing with her beloved and remark how the formalized grip of the waltz taught her Dragon Coil Technique. Once the Storyteller approves the explanation, the Sidereal pays two Willpower and the student instantly learns the Charm in question as a Training effect. With Martial Arts 6+, Secret Lesson Revelation becomes more potent. The sifu can teach Martial Arts Charms he does not personally know to his shadow fingers, provided he has seen the Charm used on at least five separate scenes to become familiar with its precepts.</p>

            <p>Not every person in Creation has a glorious destiny, but every person can live up to his destiny with grace. One of the duties of the Chosen of Venus, then, is to see that mortals and Exalted all live up to their potential.</p>
<p>This Charm enhances a social attack that encourages belief or behavior. Those that are convinced by the Sidereal and who do not spend Willpower to resist regain 1wp, even if this would grant them more than their normal maximum. Characters that accept this reward cannot later resist the influence in any way for the rest of the scene. A character cannot gain more than 1wp per scene from this Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal Lover&rsquo;s Oath is a bold declaration of the need one can feel for another, even at the expense of life itself. Use of this Charm requires binding a prayer strip around the hands of the participants in celebration of their partnership, officiated by the Sidereal. The prayer strip becomes a pair of starmetal rings adorning the finger of each of the two participants, affirming their pledge.</p>
<p>If the Sidereal binds herself to a partner with an Essence pool, both the Sidereal and her lover gain ten-mote Overdrive pools, which come into existence containing ten motes. If the Sidereal&rsquo;s partner has no Essence pool, then only the Sidereal gains the pool. If the Sidereal is binding two other characters with this Charm, then no pool is created.</p>
<p>While this Charm persists, the lovers may reflexively protect one another with Defend Other actions whenever they are within (Dexterity) yards of each other. Whenever such a Defend Other action is used successfully, the protector gains one offensive mote.</p>
<p>Should an enemy manage to strike one of the lovers through such a Defend Other action, the defender may reflexively accept as many levels of the damage as she desires herself; for each level of damage she takes onto herself, the protected lover gains two overdrive motes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ring produced by this Charm gleams brightly whenever the character&rsquo;s partner is in the grip of some powerful emotion; by paying one Willpower, the character may experience whatever emotion her partner is feeling (discovering whether it is pain, joy, sadness, etc), though no context is gained.</p>
<p>Finally, after a scene in which one of the lovers has defended her partner in some way (whether through violence or social action), the defender may roll (higher of Compassion or Conviction) to regain Willpower as though from a night&rsquo;s sleep. This benefit may apply no more than once per season.</p>
<p>A character may be subject to no more than a single Lover&rsquo;s Oath at a time. The Charm&rsquo;s effects end when either partner removes their ring voluntarily, or when one of the rings is destroyed (treat as attempting to destroy a prayer strip).</p>
<p>Venus frowns on frivolous use of this Charm. While there are no direct mechanical repercussions for crass and utilitarian use of Lover&rsquo;s Oath, misfortune has been observed to follow those who cavalierly bind their fates together.</p>

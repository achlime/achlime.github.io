        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal evokes a luminous bridle of golden stardust. Fitting the bridle to a chosen mount or animal companion ties that animal’s destiny together with the Sidereal’s. The bridle automatically sizes and shapes itself to fit the animal in question, then fades away.</p>
<p>That animal becomes a new familiar for the Vizier. If the Sidereal has no appropriate animal at hand, he can ask Mercury to lead him to a worthy specimen of a species he designates. The character gains an innate sense of the direction to an appropriate animal. The bridle remains solid and whole until he reaches his new familiar. The chosen animal allows him to approach and place the bridle upon it, already feeling the gravity of fate pulling its simple soul. The magic forcing the animal to allow a Sidereal to place the bridle upon them is an unnatural Compulsion costing 3wp to resist. Natural animals rarely do so, unless they have strong loyalty to other Essence users. If the Sidereal selects his own animal instead of letting Mercury lead him, the Charm costs an additional Willpower point to activate.</p>
<p>The animal remains a familiar, with appropriate benefits to the Sidereal, for the rest of the story. Whether the animal stays a familiar afterward depends on how the character treated the animal. If the player wants to spend experience points on the Background, the character can certainly keep the animal as a familiar (see &ldquo;Backgrounds Gained Through Charms,&rdquo; p. 126).</p>

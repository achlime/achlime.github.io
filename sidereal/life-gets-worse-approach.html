        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal makes the Inferior Sign of the Gull over his weapon before he throws it. If it hits, the attack adds the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence to the raw damage. Then, if the weapon inflicts at least one level of damage, the weapon remains stuck in the wound and emits an eerie yellow light. The weapon continues to do so until the target removes the projectile. Removing it is a miscellaneous action that requires a (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of (the Seer&rsquo;s Thrown). The light from the weapon extends yellow tendrils that snatch and pull in airborne objects. Such objects might be insects, loose debris, birds—or other foes&rsquo; projectiles.</p>
<p>Once per tick an errant missile—not necessarily aimed at the victim—within (Exalt’s Essence x 10) yards of the victim is pulled towards the embedded one. As a result, the person whose character missed with the attack reflexively rerolls the failed attack. Any Charms that supplemented or otherwise modified the original attack still apply to the rerolled one; the character does not need to pay to activate them.</p>

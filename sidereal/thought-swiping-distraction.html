        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal makes eye contact with a target for long enough to exchange a few words, however brief, and activates this Charm. When the Sidereal does so, he gets a quick impression of what the target is thinking about at that moment. The target loses his train of thought in that moment as his mind goes blank for the blink of an eye. The brief impression the Sidereal receives of the target’s surface thoughts include broad strokes only, such as “going to war” or “someone I love.” If the target is thinking of the subject of one of their Intimacies that the Sidereal is aware of, the name of the subject is provided as well.</p>
<p>This Charm can be invoked against targets up to (Sidereal’s Essence) yards away, requiring a successful (Dexterity + Larceny) roll against the target’s Dodge MDV. It grants no special insight into whether the Sidereal will interrupt meaningful thoughts, but if properly timed it imposes an external penalty of (her Larceny) on any disrupted knowledge recall and retention rolls. This is a form of unnatural Illusion; spending 2wp to ignore it immunizes one from Thought-Swiping Distraction for the rest of the scene.</p>
<p>It is impossible to maintain eye contact for long enough to use this Charm if either the target or the Sidereal engages in physical combat. The Sidereal can swipe a target&rsquo;s surface thoughts while either or both of them engage in social combat.</p>

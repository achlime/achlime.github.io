        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Desirable Maiden. He affixes the prayer strip to the forehead of one of his familiars or acquaintances (per the Backgrounds). During the next five miscellaneous actions, the person or animal blazes with golden starlight while it metamorphoses into the shape of a lesser elemental dragon of either air or water, with the scripture written on its back. This process is not gentle or pleasant, so the victim must be restrained until the transformation is complete. Otherwise, the victim can tear the strip from his forehead as a dice-less miscellaneous action. (An unrestrained witness to the transformation can do so as well.) If the prayer strip comes off before the change is finished, the victim returns to normal, decreasing the value of the Sidereal’s applicable Familiar or Acquaintances Background by one dot.</p>
<p>The dragon serves as the Vizier’s steed and fights for her. It has a Control rating of 2 (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 154)—it actively wants to carry the rider. If anyone somehow tries to ride the dragon without the Sidereal’s consent, however, the dragon has a Control rating of 5.</p>
<p>When the Charm’s duration elapses, the dragon changes back into the person, animal or minor god it once was. No longer is that being a familiar or acquaintance. Instead, the creature is a burned-out husk of its former self, forever lost in dreams of its all-too-brief glory. The creature’s Intelligence drops to zero thereafter, and it cannot care for itself; without constant invalid care, the creature will die. The only alternative is for the Sidereal to sacrifice a dot of permanent Willpower—giving part of her soul and Exaltation so her victim can become a true elemental dragon, albeit with an Essence of only 4. In time, it may grow even greater. The dragon no longer serves the Sidereal, but may become an ally through the course of play (or if the player spends the requisite experience points for a three-dot Ally).</p>

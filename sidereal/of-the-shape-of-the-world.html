        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Seers of Heaven research the future as well as the past. By studying the patterns of fate weaving through a person, place or object, a Sidereal gains information about the target&rsquo;s future. The Sidereal&rsquo;s player rolls (Intelligence + Lore); each success gives one fact about the target, such as &ldquo;This artifact will pass to a Lunar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your future holds a green-haired man&rdquo; or &ldquo;Army coming through!&rdquo; Unfortunately, the Charm does not always say when an event takes place: asking for possible events within any given one-year time span raises the difficulty to 3, and a one-month time span forces a difficulty of 5. This Charm can be invoked at most once per day regarding the same target. A full month must pass before another use of the Charm can reveal new information about the target. Sidereals understand that they see only vague shadows of the future, and that they may be changed not just by their own actions, but the actions of others.</p>

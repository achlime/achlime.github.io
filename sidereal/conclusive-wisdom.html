        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Scythe. She holds the strip up before a living target and infuses the strip with Essence. The strip sticks to the air, and violet flowers bloom all over the prayer strip. These flowers sprout, blossom, wilt and die, raining dry petals at the target&rsquo;s feet. This is all that bystanders see. The target, however, experiences the soul-upheaving horror of his own death—or at least the way he is most likely to die. Six seconds later, the target finds himself back where the Sidereal used the Charm, the ground covered in dead purple petals.</p>
<p>The Sidereal rolls (Perception + Awareness + Essence) as an unblockable social attack against the target of the Charm. While such a vision is an unnatural Illusion, it cannot be resisted with Willpower.</p>
<p>If the target is a Storyteller character, and the roll succeeds, character is forced to take a Guard action on their next action tick as the vision overwhelms their capacity to act. If the roll fails, the character&rsquo;s Willpower drops to a single point, his personal Essence drops to zero and his peripheral Essence drops by an amount equal to his maximum personal Essence (to a minimum of zero). He cannot recover Willpower or Essence for the rest of the scene.</p>
<p>If the target is a player&rsquo;s character, the Storyteller can let the aforementioned rules suffice or literally play the ending scene out for a more dramatic effect: the Storyteller then sets up a plausible death scene for the target character. The character has his full Essence pools, Willpower pool, health levels, dice pools and Charms (regardless of his actual present condition), and he participates in the scene just as if it actually happened. If target character somehow survives his doom, he comes out of the experience no worse for the wear (and it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the Sidereal succeeded on the initial roll). Within a few scenes after the vision, all of his spent Willpower points recharge. If the target of the Charm dies in the vision but the Sideareal&rsquo;s player failed on the initial roll, the character emerges from the vision shaken or awash in fatalistic calm, but suffers no ill effects. If the target of the Charm dies in the vision and the player of the Sidereal succeeded on the initial roll, the character suffers the effects noted for Storyteller characters.</p>
<p>Should the events prophesied in a player character’s vision of death come to pass, the knowledge of their fated death hangs over their head. They suffer a -3 internal penalty on any action to fight against their foretold doom, unless they pay two Willpower to resist this unnatural Emotion for one scene. Should a character succeed in fighting against destiny and survive the events prophesied to bring about their end, they recover all points of temporary Willpower, finding new hope in their second chance at life. Exalted characters also lose a point of Limit.</p>
<p>This Charm does not affect either Abyssal Exalted or the dead. The prayer strip simply disintegrates into worthless violet petals. It does, however, affect Second and Third Circle demons as normal&hellip; for the Primordial War taught them they can die, without any hope of reincarnation.</p>

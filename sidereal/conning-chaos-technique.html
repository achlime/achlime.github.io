        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip on which is written the Scripture of the Savory Maiden. The Essence-infused prayer strip goes rigid and affixes itself to the air as if the strip were nailed to a board. As the strip pulses with green light, the Sidereal names a victim within 10 miles. For just a moment, the victim sees a glowing green image of the prayer strip as viewed through the Exalt&rsquo;s eyes. After that, the victim&rsquo;s destiny becomes a bargaining chip between the Maidens and the nameless, formless entities of the deepest Wyld. The Wyld accepts the victim&rsquo;s destiny in exchange for surrendering what seems like a miniscule fraction of the Wyld back into Creation. At the time, the Wyld does not realize—perhaps because it cannot—that its hold over the victim&rsquo;s destiny is temporary, but territory ceded to fixed and stable Creation is lost to it forever. Hindsight reveals the Wyld&rsquo;s folly, however, so the more often a Sidereal tricks the Wyld into this lopsided bargain, the angrier the Wyld grows with her. If she uses this Charm too frequently, the Sidereal will find herself the target of chaotic forces from beyond Creation&rsquo;s rim.</p>
<p>When the character activates the Charm, her player rolls (Manipulation + Larceny) against a difficulty of her chosen victim&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll succeeds, chaos plagues the victim&rsquo;s destiny for one month per success rolled. Fair Folk or Wyld creatures might seek him out with malicious intent—or (just as bad) to do him what they consider &ldquo;favors.&rdquo; Or, he might suffer physical or mental mutation: each month, the victim&rsquo;s player rolls to avoid Wyld mutation as if the character was in a Middlemarch&hellip; but at difficulty 5. (See Exalted, pp. 288–290, for basic Wyld mutations; additional physical mutations and mental derangements appear in Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II—The Wyld and Manual of Exalted Power—The Lunars). The exact nature of the curse is up to the Storyteller, but the character should be harried or mentally damaged or physically mutated—not all three at once (at least in the same month).</p>
<p>While this curse lasts, the victim&rsquo;s player can make an extended (Intelligence + Lore) roll once per month for the character to gain an understanding of the curse. With six successes, it occurs to him that the prayer strip he saw when the curse came into effect must have been within 10 miles of him at that point and that destroying the strip would free him. With 12 successes, he figures out its precise location.</p>
<p>In return for each month of the victim&rsquo;s torment, the Wyld cedes one square mile of the Bordermarches to Creation, or (for an inhabited region) a dominion of Magnitude 0 (see the Exalted Storytellers Companion, p. 133). The Sidereal can specify a region or Wyld-tainted community to bring into Creation.</p>

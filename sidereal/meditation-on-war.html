        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Mighty as the blessings of the Maidens may be, the true weapon of the Sidereal Exalted is neither fist nor daiklave nor destiny nor even Essence—it is the world itself and their ability to shape it. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Whenever the Sidereal successfully blocks an attack using her Parry DV while taking a Defend Other action to protect an individual she has instructed in some way in the past, or when such an individual protects her the same way, she gains two offensive motes. “Instruction” in this case includes not only characters who have learned Charms, sorcery, or new Abilities or Specialty dots from the Sidereal, but also those that have significantly benefitted from her advice or stratagems, at the Storyteller’s discretion.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Sidereal gains the ability to spend her Overdrive motes to fuel the attacks of not only herself, but also of former students (as defined above) within (Essence x 50) yards.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A character can use this Charm only while he walks outside fate, per the prerequisite Charm. When he uses it, the Sidereal can whisper to someone and make the listener think the words come from her own mind. This Charm enhances social attacks to encourage a belief in the target, these attacks are not unexpected; the target&rsquo;s MDVs applies normally. The Seer can enhance those attacks with Charms based on other social Abilities.</p>
<p>If the social attack is successful, the target must spend 3wp to recognize that the belief came from outside her own thoughts. If the attack fails, the listener&rsquo;s player attempts a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty equal to the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence. If the roll succeeds, the words still whisper in her mind as her own voice, but she knows that the thoughts are not her own.</p>
<p>The Charm lasts for one social attack, or five minutes (five long ticks) if the Sidereal merely wants to talk to the target.</p>

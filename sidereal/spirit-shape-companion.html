        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a Sidereal uses this Charm on a beloved—or, at least, long-suffering—familiar, she transforms that animal into a small god whose only duty is to serve that character. Should the Sidereal release the familiar from her service or die in the line of duty, though, the Celestial Bureaucracy might assign the small god to some other duty. An uplifted familiar adds one dot to its Background rating. The familiar gains new scores of Essence 2 and minima of Compassion 2, Conviction 3, Temperance 1 and Valor 2. The familiar’s Intelligence also increases to 2 (if it was lower) and becomes more humanlike in order to facilitate communication. The familiar’s health levels rise to a number at least equal to its (Willpower + Conviction), adding equal numbers of -1 and -2 health levels to make up any shortfall. The former animal’s Essence pool equals (Essence x 10) + (Willpower x 5). Just as any familiar, if the small god’s Background rating is three dots or higher, the familiar has an additional pool of five motes that only its master can use.</p>
<p>As a spirit, the familiar’s natural state is now dematerialized. The familiar no longer needs to eat or drink as a normal animal (though the habits remain). The familiar automatically learns the <a class="complex" href="../spirit/materialize.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Materialize'"><span class="link-focus">Materialize</span></a> Charm (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 295), but can manifest itself visually for only a single mote of Essence. A divine familiar worth three or more dots also learns one additional universal spirit Charm of the Storyteller’s choosing. Finally, the familiar gains the ability to assume an alternative appearance that blends humanoid characteristics with the creature’s own animal form. Changing from one form to another is a miscellaneous action with no cost or dice roll.</p>
<p>A Sidereal can use this Charm only on his own familiars.</p>

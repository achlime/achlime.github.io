        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is power beyond reckoning and often folly to demand of the gods of the sky, when one can trade with them instead. This Charm is a social attack against a spirit strongly associated with the wind and the air, including air elementals, gods of sail boats, ghosts whose death involved falling from a great height and many of Adorjan’s children. The Exalt entreats the spirit to understand her own point of view, and in turn sympathizes with the desires of the divinity, rolling ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) and adding (Survival) extra successes.</p>
<p>Success imposes an unnatural Emotion on both the Exalt and her target, the spirit gaining an Intimacy of the Sidereal’s choice, while the Exalt gains an Intimacy that the spirit already possesses, chosen by the spirit’s player. These Intimacies are strong and not easily shed. Social attacks that exploit them become unnatural influence, and to act contrary to or erode the Intimacy costs 1wp per scene. At the end of the current story, both lose their magic and become normal Intimacies.</p>

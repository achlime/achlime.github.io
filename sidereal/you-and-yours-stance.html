        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm lays bare the lust that all must feel for Exalted heroes. Those that are friendly try to please the Sidereal, while those that are hostile turn to bitter rage that they cannot find it within themselves to please her. Characters that wish to attack the Sidereal must overcome their own desire for her, requiring a Conviction roll much like a Morale check (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 156-157), with a rating based on the apparent ability for the Exalt to fulfill the attacker’s desires. The more willing or capable she may seem, or the more singular the means at her disposal, the higher the difficulty, to a maximum of difficulty 3. Likewise, outside of combat, characters must roll Temperance in a similar manner to perform actions that they believe would displease the Sidereal while they can see her or believe that she can see them.</p>
<p>These rolls need be made no more than once per action, but failure prevents one from carrying out any contrary actions unless the transgressor spends 2wp to ignore this Charm’s unnatural Emotion. After spending Willpower to resist twice, a character is immunized against this Charm for the rest of the scene.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the world cries out desperately to be saved by an agent of Heaven, it is not the harrowing tale of his journey that is most important—though tales will be told. What matters most in saving the world is that the Sidereal be where he is needed. Activating this Charm, the Sidereal wraps a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden around his neck like a scarf, causing it to exude a scent of lilacs and decay. As long as it does so, he does not so much move from place to place as simply arrive at each point on his journey without crossing the intervening space. The Exalt ignores the difficulties of terrain, including water, muck and unstable terrain, and any hazards between his starting and stopping points each tick he moves.</p>
<p>Perhaps more impressive, the Sidereal may take a moment to plot his course more carefully, determining his ultimate goal and ignoring the obstacles in between. This requires a Miscellaneous action and expenditure of 1wp, which allows the Exalt to teleport up to (Essence x 10) yards to a point that he can see clearly. He has given up the accidental self-determination of those with more uncertain journeys, and so cannot perform any normal movement actions (Dash, Move, etc.) until his next action tick.</p>
<p>The first effect of this Charm contests wards against teleportation with a normal roll-off, while the latter fails automatically.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By tuning her Essence to resonate with one of the 25 constellations and its corresponding astrological college, a Sidereal can attune herself to a particular Ability and use its first three Excellencies with greater efficiency. Each two motes committed to this Charm reduce the mote cost for the first three Excellencies, to a minimum of zero. A character may never spend more than twice her permanent Essence on this Charm; and an Exalt may employ only one Propitious (Ability) Alignment at a time.</p>
<p>Propitious (Ability) Alignment is incompatible with the Fateful Excellency: while employing this Charm, one cannot apply Essence Auspicious to any dice pool involving that Ability. If a character does so, the Propitious Alignment immediately ends. On the other hand, every dot a character has in an Ability’s corresponding astrological college reduces the cost of Propitious (Ability) Alignment by one mote, to a minimum of 1. Thus, a Sidereal with Essence 3 and four levels of the Mask could spend two motes, and get the same results as if she spent six motes on Propitious Stealth Alignment.</p>
<p>In every other way, Propitious (Ability) Alignment follows the same rules as <a class="complex" href="../solar/infinite-ability-mastery.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Infinite (Ability) Mastery'"><span class="link-focus">Infinite (Ability) Mastery</span></a>.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm involves a complicated song in Old Realm. The song takes a full hour to perform, and mastering its complexities and subtleties requires a successful (Intelligence + Performance) roll at difficulty 9. Additional Sidereals can add their voices in support, even if they do not have the Charm themselves. Any priest may assist (which includes all Sidereals, as well as all Zenith, Midnight, Malefactor and No Moon Caste Exalts), but they must know the Charm and the Old Realm language to assist. When using this charm with support, use the limited teamwork rules (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 125), with each assisting Sidereal providing a bonus success rather than an extra die.</p>
<p>A successful binding can bind any spirit with Essence up to three dots greater than the Sidereal&rsquo;s, to a maximum of 7, and grants them an extra Motivation to protect and promote a social group with Magnitude no greater than (the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence x 2). For one season, that spirit is bound by the words to seek the joy, health and pleasure of a particular dominion (as defined by the Mandate of Heaven system from Exalted Storyteller&rsquo;s Companion) assigned by the Sidereal. When that time is up, memories of who summoned and bound the spirit slip from the spirit&rsquo;s mind, and the spirit is free to go.</p>

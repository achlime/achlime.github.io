        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The portentous nature of the Sidereal Exalted impresses itself upon the world as the nature of any Exalt might overwhelm a person. They supplant the circumstance and desire of all of Creation with their plans. An Exalt using this Charm affixes a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Drowning Maiden in his shadow, wrestling the world into the desired shape and pinning it there with a knotted sutra. As he does so, he decrees to the world what it must do, a circumstance or occurrence that must take place within the current scene, and it will happen in the most plausible way possible.</p>
<p>This is a far-reaching Charm, and potentially very strange. It narratively creates new resources for the Sidereal, but these are things that have always existed in the world. Wealth arrives by way of a lost Guild caravan. During a pitched battle in the wilderness, &ldquo;reinforcements&rdquo; arrive in the form of a native horde that hates one side more than the other. Evidence of a crime is covered up by a sudden house fire. This Charm creates and sets scenes, and even introduces new characters. This means that it is often Shaping, but it may instead act as a Compulsion on the animals and people nearby who could fulfill the needs of the Sidereal&rsquo;s vision.</p>
<p>Generally, phenomena and obstacles conjured by this Charm should have values for Damage, Trauma, difficulties, external penalties, or most other values that are no higher than (Exalt&rsquo;s Essence). Obstacles might have soak values double that. When the Sidereal&rsquo;s desired destiny requires characters, the closest, relevant and most likely to be susceptible candidates have their MDV compared to the Exalt&rsquo;s (Manipulation + Presence). If their MDV is lower, the candidates are subject to an unnatural Compulsion to fulfill the destiny, unless they spend 4wp to ignore it. Characters with higher MDVs, or who reject the influence before they fulfill the destiny, cause this Charm to search for the next best candidates, but no more than once during each of the Sidereal&rsquo;s actions.</p>

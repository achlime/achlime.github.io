        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm using a prayer strip inscribed with the Scripture of the Clay Maiden. Infused with Essence, the strip rises into the air above the Sidereal&rsquo;s bow (holding steady at 10 yards) and glows a garish pink. The strip&rsquo;s influence triples the effective range for the character&rsquo;s Archery attacks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the character can perform the Generalized Ammunition Technique in reverse: he can transform arrows in flight into other materials or phenomena found in Creation&hellip; not all of them physical. The character learns one transformation when he first learns the Charm. He can learn as many other transformations as he pleases, either when he first learns the Charm or later, but each additional one costs one experience point (or two for one bonus point). During a scene in which this Charm is active, the Sidereal can use only one transformation per attack. Each arrow so transformed costs one mote. A character cannot transform projectiles he improvises with the Generalized Ammunition Technique or on arrows made of the magical materials. Some sample transformations include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boulder</strong>: In mid-flight, the arrow transforms from a simple wooden shaft to a large boulder. The projectile becomes unblockable. It also doubles its raw damage against inanimate objects. The base Damage of the attack becomes (Exalt’s Essence) if it would be lower. Those who fail to defend suffer automatic Knockdown.</li>
<li><strong>Essence</strong>: The Sidereal draws her fingers through her anima and plucks a streamer of starfire to draw against her bowstring. She then fires this bolt into her target’s anima, suffusing it with her own. For every one mote the Sidereal pays on this attack, she transfers two offensive motes to the target’s Overdrive pool, if they have one. The Sidereal may pay up to three motes when firing Essence. In addition to offensive motes, the target character’s anima twinkles and shimmers with tinges of the Sidereal’s own until the end of the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Fire</strong>: The arrow dissolves in the air, to be replaced by a rain of fire. Everything within (Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence) yard of the target suffers one action&rsquo;s worth of environmental damage, as if from a bonfire (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 131). Paper, dry grass, grease and other easily combustible substances catch fire. By paying 1wp in Step 1 of resolution, the Exalt may increase the hazard’s Damage and Trauma to (Essence).</li>
<li><strong>Glass</strong>: The projectile becomes an arrow of perfectly transparent glass. There is no roll. The difficulty of tracking the arrow’s flight subtracts an external penalty of (Exalt’s Essence) from the target’s DV, but the attack’s minimum damage becomes 1 and it loses the Piercing tag, regardless of its usual properties.</li>
<li><strong>Grain</strong>: Where the arrow lands, a patch of ripe wheat grows, sufficient to feed one person for one day. The arrow must land in open ground for this effect to work. If the arrow hits a creature on open ground, the effect does not work unless that arrow also kills the creature. The Cost of using this option increases by 1m for every previous use in the same scene.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: The Exalt rolls the minimum damage of the attack, healing levels of damage instead of inflicting harm. Soak does not hamper this power.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong>: The arrow disintegrates in midair, and the attacker compares successes on his roll to the target&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value instead of Dodge Defense Value. If the attack &ldquo;hits,&rdquo; the target falls madly in love with the first person the target sees. The effect is an Intimacy that the target cannot voluntarily erode for a number of days equal to the attacker&rsquo;s Essence. Ensuing events dictate whether the feelings linger or wither.</li>
<li><strong>Precipitation</strong>: For one minute after the arrow lands, rain or snow falls in the area (whichever is the least unlikely for the location and time of year). The affected area is 100 yards in diameter per dot of the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence. The Exalt may pay a surcharge of 1wp to force snow or rain out-of-season.</li>
</ul>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal writes a prayer strip with the Scripture of That Old Thing as she ponders a specific question or subject of interest to her. The Sidereal buries the prayer strip like a seed and waters it with her own blood. In a single day, the strip sprouts roots and rapidly grows into a tall mulberry tree that attracts the gratified attention of local wood spirits. These spirits either leave small gifts or write secrets on the fallen leaves.</p>
<p>The Sidereal may return to the site on the fifth day. Her player then rolls (Charisma + Investigation) as the character looks through the wood spirits&rsquo; offerings. For each success on the roll, the Sidereal finds a piece of information useful to resolving her quandary—some hint about the answer to her question or an idea about where to look for more information—as well as an interesting trinket. These gifts seldom possess significant monetary value&hellip; but occasionally turn out to be just what the character needs later.</p>
<p>The clues and trinkets do not necessarily imply any special knowledge on the part of the wood spirits leaving them. They are compelled by this Charm to find and deposit elements of a prophecy they may have no part in. This unnatural Compulsion targets only minor spirits, and is irresistible. The affected spirits come from within 10 miles; if none are present for any reason, this Charm fails.</p>
<p>Returning to the tree before five days pass offends the spirits before they finish leaving gifts. For each day the Sidereal refuses to wait, remove one success from the player&rsquo;s roll.</p>
<p>Outside of Creation and Yu-Shan, there are no nature gods to answer the call of the Embracing Life Method, preventing this Charm from functioning unless the Sidereal can make an appropriate stunt to circumvent this limitation. Examples include pouring out extra libations of blood to draw ghosts in the Underworld, or disguising the tree as a metallic sculpture to appease Autochthonian exmachina.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal buys protection from one element through a sacrifice of pain to one of that element&rsquo;s gods. Despite the name, a Seer can gain protection from any one element at a time, not just water or fire. To activate this Charm, the Sidereal must touch a sample of the chosen element, such as a hearth-fire, a bucket of water, a tree, the ground or a passing breeze. As long as the character keeps Essence committed to the Charm, that element cannot harm her. Water cannot drown, freeze or boil her; fire cannot burn her, nor desert heat give her sunstroke; plants do not hinder her, poison her or tear her flesh with their thorns; and so on.</p>
<p>This Charm may be activated multiple times, each time to protect against a different element. Each activation protects against one of the five cardinal elements: Air, Earth, Fire, Water or Wood. The aggregate effect of the Charm is to provide comprehensive protection against environmental hazards of all kinds, as long as they are not attacks from characters. Each activation after the first halves its mote cost, to a minimum of 1m. Motes are committed in aggregate and released based on the number of activations, not in the order in which the Charm&rsquo;s uses were paid for.</p>
<p>With a drop of blood and an act of will, powerful Sidereals may extend the protection of Water and Fire Treaty against the environmental attacks of characters. Viziers with Essence 4+ may make a special activation of this Charm, altering its health level cost to be lethal, to apply the Charm&rsquo;s effects against such attacks for the rest of the scene. They need not sample an element to activate Water and Fire Treaty this way.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm using a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden&rsquo;s Promise. When she infuses the strip with Essence and casts the strip on the ground, the strip explodes in a flash of amethyst light. While the Sidereal himself is immune to the effect, all the people present feels an unnatural mental influence to cease their arguing over whatever they disagree about. A customer would stop haggling with the vendor and just split the difference between the listed price and what he wanted to pay before, which the vendor would gladly accept just to make a sale. Two rowdy street gangs would decide to just let this turf squabble go this time and move off in separate directions. The senators of the Lesser House of the Deliberative would cease their semi-civilized bickering and just put the contentious issue to a vote.</p>
<p>The use of this Charm is a social attack against those present, the Sidereal rolling (Charisma + Bureaucracy) and adding (Essence) automatic successes versus Dodge MDV. Individuals can resist the Charm by spending three Willpower. The Sidereal can use this Charm to affect a group of characters whose Magnitude does not exceed his Essence.</p>
<p>A Sidereal may instead strip conflict of interest and graft from a bureaucrat, rolling Strength instead of Charisma against a single target. If successful, the target suffers the effects of <a class="complex" href="icy-hand.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Icy Hand'"><span class="link-focus">Icy Hand</span></a> indefinitely and with no mote commitment from the Exalt. The only way to escape his Compulsion to duty is for the target to resign from his position, though he may take up another job in which to laze and extort.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A ship is a tiny refuge of human order in the vast, inhuman sea. By tracing the burning yellow Sign of Journeys on a ship&rsquo;s prow, a Sidereal protects the ship and its passengers against supernatural forces. One version of the Charm protects the ship from gods and elementals, another from the Fair Folk and the Wyld, a third from the dead and forces of the Underworld and a fourth from demons and forces of Malfeas. Sidereals gain access to all versions of this Charm when they learn it. A vessel can carry only one form of protection at a time, though.</p>
<p>A banned entity cannot touch or board the ship unless the entity&rsquo;s Essence exceeds the Sidereal&rsquo;s. The Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence is also added to any dice pool or single value needed for the ship or passengers to resist a banned entity or environment, such as the roll to resist Wyld mutation, or another character&rsquo;s Essence to resist the <a class="complex" href="../spirit/malediction.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Malediction'"><span class="link-focus">Malediction</span></a> power of the Storm Mother Sikunare. It does not provide bonus dice to DVs, but instead it imposes an equal external penalty on the attacks of aggressors. It costs 2wp per action for trespassers and aggressors to ignore this Charm&rsquo;s effects. Characters that have resisted three times ignore the effect for the rest of the scene.</p>

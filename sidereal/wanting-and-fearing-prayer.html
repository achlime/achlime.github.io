        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In each hand, the Sidereal holds a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Whore. He infuses the strips with Essence and names a target for each strip. (These targets must both be within 10 miles of the Sidereal.) The prayer strips disappear in flashes of blue flame (an Obvious event, but nothing about the Charm is Obvious to the targets). Each one then reappears wrapped around a bone in the named targets&rsquo; bodies. The targets can&rsquo;t feel or see the embedded prayer strip unless the flesh over the strip is somehow removed. For as long as the Charm remains in effect, those particular bones become as difficult to damage as the prayer strips themselves (per the rules on destroying a prayer strip, on p. 125).</p>
<p>Activating this Charm is a five-minute ceremony wherein the Sidereal consecrates the relationship he is fabricating. He must have spent at least a scene interacting with both targets at some point in the current story, and he must have gauged their hearts by reading their motivations successfully (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 131).</p>
<p>When the Sidereal&rsquo;s player activates the Charm he makes a single roll of (Manipulation + Socialize) against both the targets&rsquo; Dodge Mental Defense Values, adding his Essence in automatic successes. If he succeeds against both targets, he can then craft a new relationship (social and emotional) between the two targets. This relationship lasts for as long as the strips remain within the targets&rsquo; bodies, even if the targets have never met each other before: fate inexorably pushes the two characters together into their new relationship. While the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence remains committed, the targets experience a magically enforced Intimacy toward each other. The targets may act against the imposed Intimacy without spending Willpower, but they suffer appropriate penalties (see the <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#emotion" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Emotion'"><span class="link-focus">Emotion</span></a> keyword, page 10). If a character spends a number of Willpower points equal to the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence, the effect ends for that character. (Half of the committed Essence is no longer committed.) The other targeted character remains under the effect, however.</p>
<p>Surgery can dislodge a prayer strip, but doing so requires 12 successes on an extended (Dexterity + Medicine) action and inflicts one level of unsoakable lethal damage. The difficulty of each roll during the surgery to remove a prayer strip is 6. If a strip is removed in this way, the Essence committed to the strip is no longer committed, but the other strip is not affected.</p>
<p>Once the Charm ends, the targets still have the designated Intimacies toward each other, but they become normal Intimacies. Without the Illusion effect to reinforce the Intimacy, the two characters can lose the Intimacy by normal means, or keep it if they (and their players) so desire.</p>

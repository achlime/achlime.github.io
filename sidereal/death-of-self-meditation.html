            <p>The world is a place of trials, constantly tearing away what you are to make you who you will be. Let those things go, and they trouble you not! A Sidereal may activate this Charm when faced with unnatural influence, shedding an Intimacy related to it. It does not matter if the Intimacy would have been opposed or complementary to the influence, as long as it would have provided either a bonus or penalty to MDV resisting its imposition. Any such influence is perfectly dodged, spiraling away into nothingness along with the Sidereal&rsquo;s old loves and hates. The lost Intimacy cannot be regained by any means for the rest of the story.</p>

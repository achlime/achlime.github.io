        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the character first learns this Charm, a measure of his Essence crystallizes in his mouth in the form of a small emerald pattern spider. The character spits out this indestructible construct, whereupon it immediately dematerializes and attaches itself to a part of his body. Thereafter, the character may spend two motes of Essence to instruct the spirit to fetch some particular piece of information for him. If the information is available and not actively concealed, the spider scuttles away along the weave of fate. The spider returns in the space of a miscellaneous action and whispers the information to the Sidereal.</p>
<p>The pattern spider can only retrieve simple, objective facts. It can answer questions such as, &ldquo;What is that shopkeeper&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; or &ldquo;When did it last rain in Nexus?&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Who stabbed Sesus Lahor?&rdquo; It cannot answer questions such as, &ldquo;Does the shopkeeper hate me?&rdquo; (the spider doesn&rsquo;t read minds), &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s winning the battle?&rdquo; (the spider has no strategic sense) or &ldquo;Who murdered Sesus Lahor?&rdquo; (murder, unlike stabbing, is a matter of intent). Questions such as, &ldquo;What is the Bull of the North up to?&rdquo; usually give unhelpful answers, such as, &ldquo;Eating lunch.&rdquo; The pattern spider cannot retrieve information that is actively hidden or innately esoteric, such as spells, and the spider does not function in regions where fate&rsquo;s influence is weak, such as the Wyld, shadowlands or Malfeas. This Charm can deliver any single fact that is known to at least 100 people that are part of fate, as long as that fact is not actively concealed or generally lost. As a rough guideline, as long as an uncontested Investigation, Lore or Occult roll, with difficulty 5 or less, could have been validly made within most of Creation, the spider can find and retrieve it from the records of Heaven.</p>
<p>As an alternative to pulling such answers from the Loom of Fate, the Sidereal can send the spider with a query to her own library, in Creation or Yu-Shan, for her assistants to look up. The answer falls within the spider&rsquo;s purview because the answer is objective information—what the Sidereal&rsquo;s staff can locate in books—rather than anything so nebulous as truth. Such answers take longer to retrieve, of course. As an exception to the stricture against finding information that is actively hidden or would otherwise call for a difficulty 6+ roll to find out, the spider can retrieve any information that is currently kept within the Sidereal’s personal libraries in Yu-Shan or Creation. This exception does not apply if someone else hid the information in the Sidereal’s library.</p>
<p>The spider travels along the Exalt’s own insuperable thread of fate, and can continue to retrieve information even while in Hell or the outer Chaos of the Wyld. Wards against scrying apply against this Charm, but the Sidereal gains (Essence) extra successes on her roll-off.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal glares or points imperiously at a troublesome water elemental, river god or similar spirit, radiating all the authority of the Maiden of Journeys. A yellow aura surrounds the targeted spirit, and it suddenly remembers something important to do elsewhere. Perhaps the spirit neglected to deliver a delinquent report to its superior. Perhaps an offering awaits the spirit at a shrine downstream. Perhaps Mercury needs to speak to the spirit personally about a pressing matter. This understanding is not false. A legitimate reason to be someplace else does occur to the troublesome spirit, though the Sidereal doesn&rsquo;t know what the reason is. When this understanding comes upon the spirit, it must act on the understanding.</p>
<p>This Charm only affects spirits strongly associated with water, be they gods, demons, or even ghosts whose death involved drowning or being killed at sea. The target must be within (Essence x 10) yards. Use of the Charm acts as a social attack, the Sidereal rolling ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Sail) against the target&rsquo;s MDV. If the spirit wants to do anything other than set out immediately, the spirit must spend 3wp to resist the Compulsion to go elsewhere right away, spending Willpower resists the Compulsion for the rest of the scene. Each time the Sidereal&rsquo;s anima flares to a new level, the spirit must resist again as if the attack had succeeded with 0 extra successes.</p>
<p>Even when the truculent spirit resists the Compulsion, the world itself dooms them for shirking their duties elsewhere. Other characters reduce by one the target number of actions they take that would drive the spirit away, including physical attacks and social attacks to convince the target to leave.</p>

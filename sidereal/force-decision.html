        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When people face choices, wise Viziers shape the people&rsquo;s decisions. The Sidereal subtly channels Essence into a victim so he makes the decision that the Seer wants. The victim may not be more than (Essence x 5) yards away. At the time, the decision seems perfectly natural to the target character forced to make it, though he might come to regret it later and wonder what possessed him to choose as he did. The Seer&rsquo;s player need merely succeed at a (Manipulation + Presence) roll at a difficulty of the target&rsquo;s MDV; the character can affect anyone she can see. It costs 2wp to ignore this unnatural Compulsion.</p>
<p>The Charm works only on people who really are weighing different options: it can&rsquo;t force a person to drop whatever he&rsquo;s doing to go do something else. Any decision imposed must be at least a plausible option in the circumstances: when the Regent ponders what wine to have with dinner, you can&rsquo;t make him decide to declare war on Thorns. Worst of all, the Charm doesn&rsquo;t hold the target to his decision. Habitual wafflers may still change their minds a few minutes later. (Bronze Faction Sidereals have learned that using Force Decision on Regent Fokuf is futile and unnecessary: he agrees with whatever <em>anyone</em> suggests&hellip; and changes his mind the next time anyone speaks.)</p>

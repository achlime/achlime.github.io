        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The wilderness is not a hazard to itself, and each part unto its other parts is as one beautiful, moving Tapestry. By activating this Charm, the Sidereal becomes another part of the wild, and it accepts him warmly. The Exalt ignores the environmental impediments of the untamed wilderness, which is distinct from sculpted gardens or the body-realms of titans. This allows him to ignore external penalties or difficulty increases from these factors, the difficulties of unstable footing or water and muck (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 155), or exhaustion from extreme temperatures (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 130). On rolls that would suffer these penalties, the Seer may channel his Valor. The Exalt travels at his maximum overland travel speed with little effort, as if he were on a leisurely walk and ignoring any reductions to his travel speed due to weather, terrain or magic.</p>
<p>With a Survival and Essence 3+ repurchase, the Sidereal has come to an understanding that all places are wilderness to those unfamiliar. He may activate this Charm to function in either true untamed wilderness or in more structured, cultivated places such as cities and towns. The Exalt cannot make use of both functions at once, and the divine structure of titan bodies remain too potent to ignore until Essence 4+.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The subtle Viziers find social groups to influence that no one else knew existed&hellip; including the social group itself. This Charm weaves strands of fate to draw together people who may not have known each other before. As they meet and discover common interests, they form a new social unit that can then become a target for social mass combat or manipulation.</p>
<p>The Sidereal spends a full week in a wider community, meeting people and talking, spreading a net of ideas and fate. Her player rolls (Wits + Socialize). Loyalty is determined normally, and the potential Magnitude of the group is simply equal to the rolled successes, subject to available membership. The Sidereal defines the Policy for the new social unit, but has no control over which individuals join. Otherwise, the social unit operates on its own. If it survives, its Policy may evolve beyond what the Sidereal defined.</p>
<p>The Sidereal’s roll determines the quality of the group and its leader. Ensnared members have competencies relevant to the group’s Policy on a scale of none (one success) to expert (4+ ratings in Abilities; five or more successes). The Vizier can make herself the group&rsquo;s leader, but only through crafting a resplendent destiny for that purpose. If the Exalt does not craft a destiny to become the leader, the leader is pulled from the pool of members, but may not have an unmodified Dodge MDV higher than the successes rolled to activate this Charm. Ignoring this unnatural Servitude call to duty costs a member 1wp per day, and the pull to join falls away after they resist (Sidereal’s Essence) days.</p>
<p>Any conceivable common interest can become the basis of a social unit, and the group can have any goal the Sidereal wants. Improbable combinations, such as a garden club that wants to overthrow a despot, result in social units that probably do not last very long.</p>

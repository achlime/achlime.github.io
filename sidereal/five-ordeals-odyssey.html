        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In their travels, sometimes the Seers of Heaven encounter problems that make further progress seem impossible. In such cases, a Sidereal can channel Essence into a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden at Sea. He casts the strip into the air, where the prayer strip explodes in a flash of golden lightning.</p>
<p>Before the scene ends, something happens to remove the obstacle to his travel: a sudden squall blows away the approaching pirates, the desert caravan that has run out of water finds an oasis, a secret tunnel offers a way into the fortress, giant birds nest on the island where he is stranded. But the Sidereal (and any companions) have only traded one trouble for another, equally severe but possibly soluble: the squall also blows the Sidereal&rsquo;s ship aground in a dangerous land, the oasis has a Fair Folk mistress who transforms men into beasts, the secret passage is prone to dangerous rock falls, catching a ride on a giant bird takes the Sidereal to a valley of the giant snakes the birds feed upon. This new threat is locked into destiny, so a Seer cannot use Five Ordeals Odyssey again to attempt another escape and perhaps some lesser danger. The Charm also cannot remove impediments to travel that come from outside fate, such as attacking nephwracks or storms of Wyld energy.</p>
<p>The Charm obviously demands some skill at improvisation from the Storyteller. Whenever a character with this Charm takes a journey, it helps to prepare one or two scenes of replacement perils that can be plugged into the story at any point.</p>

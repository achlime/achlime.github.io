        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal can train a small team of spirits, Exalted, and any other beings that are part of fate, into an elite fighting unit. This team can include no more members than the Sidereal has (War + Essence). When he trains them in this way, though, the Sidereal weaves their fates into a stout lash that strikes as one, even when the characters are not physically together. This Charm is a week-long dramatic training session, with effects that last for the rest of its Duration. It may be renewed reflexively as it lapses, but any delay requires retraining.</p>
<p>The individuals affected by the Charm are treated as a single being for the purposes of Sidereal astrology effects in the House of Battles. This solo unit&rsquo;s Essence the highest of any one member, plus one for every other member whose permanent Essence exceeds 3, for determining the astrology effect&rsquo;s Scope. While the effect lasts, the Sidereal trainer&rsquo;s astrology effects in the House of Battles that are directed at the unit apply equally to each member of that team, even when those team members work independently.</p>

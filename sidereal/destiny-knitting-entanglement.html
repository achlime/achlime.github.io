        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By handling an object, a Seer can bind its destiny to his own. This Charm can target any object the character owns (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 238), as long as no other Essence user owns it. The character may reflexively spend two motes of Essence to learn the object&rsquo;s general circumstances—where it is, what sort of person has it, what that person is doing with it. The Sidereal can instead spend the two motes to engender a series of events that brings the object back to her. Perhaps a thief steals it and passes it off to a fence in the Sidereal&rsquo;s employ. Perhaps the acquaintance (per the Background) who left with the object chooses that moment to visit the Sidereal and brings it with him. If the circumstances aren&rsquo;t ideal for the Sidereal to draw the object to him, the object might not make it all the way to his hands, but it makes some progress each time. He may continue to monitor the object&rsquo;s location until the object returns to him. This Charm is a Shaping effect that dictates circumstances and actions; extras cannot resist this script for the world, while others may spend 1wp to pass off their duty to fulfill destiny to someone else.</p>
<p>If the Sidereal loses in combat an object affected by this Charm, he can call it back to his hand. Recalling an object in combat costs nothing and is reflexive. Doing so must involve the scenery or circumstances: he can&rsquo;t simply make the object float back to him. But if an enemy knocks the Sidereal&rsquo;s daiklave from his grasp, for instance, an arrow meant for the Sidereal&rsquo;s heart might knock the tumbling blade back into his hand.</p>
<p>A Sidereal may use this Charm to observe and affect any number of objects he owns. He maintains ownership by using Destiny-Knitting Entanglement to check in at least once every day. Failure to do so allows others to claim it in full, preventing use of this Charm. Other effects that assert absolute ownership of the object will also thwart this Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip on which is written the Scripture of the Maiden and Shadow. He infuses the strip with Essence and hurls the prayer strip at a target within 100 yards. This attack can only be dodged, not parried: if the target tries to parry, the strip sticks to the parrying limb or weapon. If the strip hits the target, the strip sticks to him for the duration of the effect, wreathing him in a sickly yellow glow.</p>
<p>Hitting with the prayer strip inflicts no damage. It cannot be removed short of destroying it. With the prayer strip stuck to him, the target feels an insane compulsion (an unnatural mental influence) to hurt the Sidereal who put the strip there. The Compulsion prevents the victim from removing or allowing the removal of the prayer strip. Resisting this urge costs one Willpower point per action, and it is ignored for the rest of the scene after doing so five times.</p>
<p>Whenever the Sidereal takes damage during the effect&rsquo;s duration, a hatchet made of yellow Essence appears in one of his free hands. As a reflexive action, he may cast this hatchet at the target wrapped in the prayer strip at any distance up to a quarter of a mile away. The Sidereal may fling Essence hatchets in response to damaging attacks from characters other than the bearer of the prayer strip. Attacks without real harmful intent behind them or attacks against which the character chooses not to apply his DV do not allow the Sidereal to reflexively attack and heal.</p>
<p>These hatchet attacks occur in Step 9 as a Counterattack, preventing the use of other Counterattack effects on the part of the Exalt. The hatchet shrieks through the air, ignoring obstacles, and requiring no roll on the Sidereal&rsquo;s behalf. Only a perfect parry or dodge can prevent the hatchet from hitting the affected character. When it hits, it inflicts dice of lethal damage equal to the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence. For each health level the target loses, the Sidereal heals one health level.</p>
<p>The effect lasts until the target dies, the Sidereal ceases to commit the Essence or the prayer strip is destroyed. Sidereals may maintain as many uses of this Charm as they wish, to the limits of their motes, Willpower and health.</p>

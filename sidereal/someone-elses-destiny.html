        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Sidereal is exposed to a drug or poison, intentionally or unawares, she can lock it away as a memorandum attached to her fate and pass that memorandum off on someone else.</p>
<p>At the drug or poison&rsquo;s first damage interval (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 130), the Sidereal can reflexively activate this Charm instead of trying to resist the poison. When this Charm is activated, the effect of the substance separates entirely from the Sidereal&rsquo;s fate but remains in orbit around it. The substance remains suspended thus until the next time the Sidereal successfully attacks someone in close combat and her player rolls at least one die of lethal or aggravated damage. Whether the damage roll succeeds or not, the orbiting memorandum transfers to the victim of the attack, whereupon the substance&rsquo;s effects kick in immediately as if the victim had originally ingested the poison or drug himself. Applying the effect to an attack is done in Step 1 of combat resolution and is voluntary.</p>
<p>The Sidereal can contain only (Essence) maladies at a time: using this Charm to contain more than the allowed number of substances results in the first toxin&rsquo;s effect returning to the Sidereal. This Charm can capture Poison and Sickness effects, as well as influences that cause Derangements or other effects that can reasonably be called &lsquo;madness&rsquo;.</p>

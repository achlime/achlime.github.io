        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>If the Sidereal finds himself frustrated with the minutia of investigation or academic research, he can call forth a loyal helper to assist him. He need only clap his hands over a smallish living plant and activate the Charm. The plant then grows rapidly and twists itself into the shape of a clothed mortal with the Attributes and Abilities of the &ldquo;Savant&rdquo; template on pp. 280–281 of <strong>Exalted</strong>, minus any specialties. This research assistant speaks any languages the Sidereal does, and it is unfailingly helpful in the character&rsquo;s investigation and research efforts. The assistant’s ratings in Investigation, Lore and Occult are all equal to the higher of the Exalt’s permanent Essence or 4. It has a 10m pool of Essence, and possesses the First Lore and Occult Excellencies and the Second Investigation Excellency, with (Ability) dice caps. It is immune to fatigue, and does not need to sleep, breathe, eat or drink. If an attack or some other emergency imperils the assistant, though, it panics and immediately reverts to its plant form on the spot, prematurely ending the Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the Maiden and the Road. She infuses the prayer strip with Essence, buries the strip seven yards beneath the ground and then covers the strip&rsquo;s gravesite with stones. Ten beams of violet light shine from the cairn to encircle the precariously perched star of a god or elemental of earth or air that must soon face death. (The Storyteller selects which type of spirit.) Within the next 24 hours, the whispers of the Maiden of Endings lead the Sidereal and the spirit to each other.</p>
<p>When they meet, the Sidereal offers the spirit the bargain that gives this Charm its name. If the spirit refuses, it dies in that same scene, and the spirit&rsquo;s star falls from the heavens. If the spirit accepts, it vanishes from sight and binds itself to the Sidereal&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
<p>Once the spirit accepts the bargain, the spirit remains bound to the Sidereal for as long as the Sidereal keeps the Essence committed. During that time, the Sidereal reflexively recovers one lethal or bashing health level per action. Also, the spirit&rsquo;s connection provides (Essence + Charisma + Medicine) to the Sidereal’s bashing and lethal soak. This counts as natural soak and is compatible with armor.</p>
<p>If she wants, the Sidereal can transfer the bond of fate between herself and the spirit to someone else, effectively binding the spirit to that person. (Neither the spirit nor the other person has any say in the matter.) For as long as the Sidereal continues to commit the Essence to maintain the Charm, the recipient of the bond enjoys the aforementioned benefits. Once the Sidereal transfers the bond, however, she cannot take it back. The person who received the bond cannot transfer it to anyone else, either.</p>
<p>Once the Charm&rsquo;s effect ends, the spirit is reborn from within its host, slightly changed but no longer facing imminent death. Whether the spirit feels indebted to the Sidereal depends largely on the spirit&rsquo;s own nature, the length of the spirit&rsquo;s servitude and whether the Sidereal herself placed the spirit&rsquo;s life in jeopardy as a way to force the bargain.</p>

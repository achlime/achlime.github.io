        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Upon the paths of fate travels the Heptarchy of Tragedy—a group of seven gods responsible for those truths and futures that displease mortal eyes. When the Heptarchs perceive atrocities yet to come, they bundle knowledge in a living sepulcher and bury it in the earth. They might not be able to avert such a tragedy, but at least they can hide knowledge of it from those eyes the tragedy would most offend. Determined Sidereals can dredge up these sepulchers, however, and bear witness to the truths best left unspoken that are hidden in futurity.</p>
<p>Viewing the unpleasant future requires that a Sidereal engage in a three-hour astrological meditation. The aid of other Viziers, even if they do not know this Charm, allows for limited teamwork on the roll to interpret the vision (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 125), but all participants must be of different castes. The rite must be performed beneath the starry sky. The Charm unearths a buried sepulcher and grants the participants a vision of its hidden contents, from a perspective at the end of the Age of Sorrows. The participants must agree on a general topic for their prognostication, such as &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Bull of the North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Properly interpreting this glimpse requires the character&rsquo;s player to roll (Intelligence + Lore) at the end of the three-hour meditation. The more successes each player gets, the more clearly the character perceives the connection between the coming tragedy and current events.</p>
<p>A character can use this Charm no more than once per month. Repeated attempts to investigate a future tragedy do not grant further information.</p>

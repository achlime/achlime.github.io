        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm reverses its prerequisite, so an object goes from the Sidereal to someone or someplace else. The character must know this person or place by name. The Sidereal may set any object on its way with this Charm, not only those she creates, needing only the name of the place or person. She cannot target attuned artifacts, and this can be dealt with as a Shaping effect when targeting other objects.</p>
<p>The destiny-guided object moves toward its goal for as long as the Sidereal keeps Essence committed to the Charm. This may take less than a day for a person in the same town, or many months to cross Creation. Initially and each week thereafter, the Sidereal rolls (Wits + [Craft necessary to create the object]), adding (Craft [Fate]) bonus dice, to see how quickly or how far the object moves toward its destination. The Exalt may apply Excellencies normally to each roll.</p>
<p>The Storyteller sets a cumulative difficulty based on both distance and probability, which may range as high as 50. It tends to be harder for things to get from Chanta to Luthe, but if the Exalt starts the object&rsquo;s journey by dropping it into the back of a Guild caravan it should require fewer successes than leaving it on the side of the road. The cumulative difficulty for an object journeying within the same realm of existence should rarely exceed 20, and for traveling between realms of existence it should rarely be less than 30. Do not multiply the necessary successes based on cross-realm travel.</p>
<p>The difficulty for each roll is the same as the per-roll difficulty to Craft the object, as it is more likely for treasures and wonders to be caught up in new destinies. The Charm ends prematurely only if the Exalt rolls more than (Essence) botches in a row.</p>
<p>The object sent by this Charm may simply be useful in its own right—or dangerous, such as a forged map designed to lure the target into a trap. The object can also carry a Sidereal astrology effect as part of the object&rsquo;s fate-crafting, as a way to deliver ascending or descending destinies to people or places the Sidereal cannot reach directly.</p>
<p>At Craft and Essence 5+ a Sidereal may use this Charm to banish things from a realm of existence, instead of simply sending it to somewhere else. Doing so is a normal invocation of the Charm, with a cumulative difficulty appropriate to sending the object to a destination in another realm of existence. Once it passes beyond the bounds of the originating realm, however, it becomes lost to that world.</p>
<p>The destiny tangled about it will not permit it to return. As long as the motes remain committed to this Charm, the object travels freely outside the realm from which it was banned. Any attempt to return it there meets widespread cosmic resistance. For every dot of Essence the Sidereal possesses, either a botch will occur on an action necessary to return the item, similar to a broken Eclipse oath, or some new circumstance will arise to prevent or redirect its return. Once these preventive threads of destiny have been worn away, the Charm ends and the item may return freely.</p>
<p>The instant before he dies, a Vizier may empower his banishments to persist past his ending. At that time, he chooses which banishments he currently maintains that will continue and which to release normally. Thereafter, the effect cannot be undone without ablating the protective destinies that keep the object away.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal can mend damaged sections of fate in an area. Doing so requires a roll of (Dexterity + Appropriate Ability), with (Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence) bonus dice. Healing living beings requires Medicine, and inanimate objects or structures call for the appropriate Craft.</p>
<p>Each success heals a single health level that the target lost to a creature or effect of the Demon Realm, the Underworld or the Wyld; each success also repairs damage inflicted by sorcery. It can undo the direct results of actions performed by anything outside fate, as well as sorcery and necromancy spells. The difficulty of undoing non-health level effects of spells is equal to (Circle x 10).  The Charm is also effective against changes imposed by the unstable Wyld. The difficulty of undoing a mutation is equal to twice the mutation&rsquo;s point value. Undoing similar changes to inanimate things faces a similar difficulty according to Storyteller adjudication. Cleansing a contiguous area of tainted land within (Essence) miles requires (Resources value of the land x 10) successes. This Charm cannot actually turn Bordermarches into true Creation, but it can enforce the normal laws of Creation on a waypoint for the rest of the story with 30 successes.</p>
<p>Since this is a Simple Charm, with an instant duration, the only way to build up such large numbers of successes is to have large numbers of Sidereals performing the Charm simultaneously in an area.</p>
<p>With Essence 4+ a Sidereal may exert fine enough control over the warp and weft of fate that he may aid the pattern spiders more closely. When the damage a thing or character has suffered is a directly contradictory result to a Sidereal astrology destiny laid upon the victim or the vandal, the Exalt may undo the harm with Mending Warped Designs. Note that a destiny to &ldquo;parry blows&rdquo; is not contradictory to having suffered harm, but &ldquo;showing up at the dinner party unharmed&rdquo; is.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal infuses Essence into a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the Hunted Maiden and wraps the strip around his waist like a belt. The prayer strip transforms into a band of cerulean light and cinches tight, inflicting one level of unsoakable lethal damage. Every hour after that, the belt cinches tighter, inflicting one level of unsoakable bashing damage. This damage will not heal until the Charm ends.</p>
<p>With the belt in place, the character starts to walk or run. Charms or the Lesser Sign of Mercury may enhance these movement actions. He drags with him a portion of Creation with a maximum radius (in miles) equal to his Essence, with the Exalt in the center. The terrain, habitations and people within that area all relocate to the place where the Exalt stops walking or running. The territory&rsquo;s original location fills in with scenery appropriate to the geographical context, perhaps including nearby homes. Clerks in Yu-Shan monitor the transfer and make sure that the fate of every relocated person or thing is accounted for in its new position. All witnesses to or subjects of the effect remember the region&rsquo;s old geography but thereafter consider the new arrangement to be perfectly correct and reasonable. (Most minds can&rsquo;t comprehend such a grand reorganization of the Tapestry of Creation&hellip; so they ignore it.) The unnatural Illusion of this Charm costs 5wp to resist. The Sidereal may change pace as she wishes, but she can never stop moving if she wishes to keep the Charm active.</p>
<p>A Sidereal cannot use this Charm to move only parts of large discrete terrain features—such as half a mountain, a segment of a river or just the market district of a city. If the radius of effect isn&rsquo;t large enough to encompass the entire definable feature, that part of the landscape stays in place as the rest of the region moves. The moving region does not interact with physical Creation while the Sidereal moves, but he cannot drag a moving region onto an inhabited area. (The paperwork alone&hellip; You&rsquo;ve never heard such complaining.) Nor can the Sidereal drag one region onto another in order to &ldquo;erase&rdquo; something in the affected region. The Sidereal cannot, for instance, drag a lake across a forest and relocate the lake on top of a forgotten Solar&rsquo;s tomb in order to make that tomb disappear. The tomb would, instead, recede with the displaced forest to the lake&rsquo;s edge or rise from the center of the lake on a creepy, mist-shrouded island.</p>
<p>Using this Charm to relocate a region without the proper authorization is a Severity 3 offense.</p>
<p>Targeting all or most of the same area or landmarks with multiple uses of this Charm in the same day is taxing, on both the world and its Sidereal guardians. Each use in the same 25 hour period after the first costs an extra +5m. Dreams and prayers become jumbled for the inhabitants and Heaven, adding +1 to the difficulty of their Conviction rolls to regain Willpower and any prayer rolls they make for a full week after the last use of this Charm.</p>
<p>With Essence 7+, Neighborhood Relocation Scheme can be used to relocate characters that exist as living landscapes or structures, such as Mother Bog, as long as they fit completely within the range of this Charm. Such characters may either defend against the Shaping of this Charm with appropriate defenses, or resist with a (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of the Sidereal&rsquo;s (Essence). If they succeed, the Sidereal is unable to make any progress moving them for an hour. After every hour this roll can be repeated, giving the relocated character an opportunity to drag out the location or even cut it short by forcing the Sidereal to take more damage than they can safely withstand.</p>

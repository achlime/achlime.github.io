        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Beneath starry skies or at the Loom of Fate, the Sidereal meditates upon a goal important to them and chart the surest course of destiny that will see that goal accomplished. The aid of other Viziers, even if they do not know this Charm, allows for limited teamwork on the roll to interpret the vision (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 125), but all participants must be of different castes. When the character invokes the Charm, the player rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against a difficulty set by how broad and sweeping the goal is. If the roll succeeds, the character sees one true path that undeniably leads to the accomplishment of that goal&hellip; as well as the price she must pay to see it done. The price might be anything from &ldquo;minor bodily harm&rdquo; to &ldquo;the sacrifice of your families, your morals, and eventually your lives&rdquo;—depending, again, on how epic the goal is.</p>
<p>If the player agrees that the character will pay the price, the character&rsquo;s achieving the goal is assured. In most cases, the troupe still plays out the actions needed to bring about the conclusion; the result is assured, but the route might hold surprises, and other storylines and conflicts still claim the character&rsquo;s attention. In other cases, though, the Storyteller might simply narrate the scenes that lead to the accepted resolution, in between other scenes. Of Things Desired and Feared can resolve a peripheral subplot or a side quest that proves unintentionally tedious in play. Under no circumstances does the Charm grant an &ldquo;automatic-win&rdquo; option to a lazy player. The steep cost of victory should rarely be desirable over the character&rsquo;s own careful planning and hard work.</p>
<p>If the desired goal is significantly contested by powerful magic beings, usually other Exalts, or spirits with permanent Essence at least half that of the Sidereal’s, then this Charm cannot be used to overwhelm them. This is a very loose guideline, and Storytellers are encouraged to ignore it if the conflict is incidental to their story or would be uninteresting in extended play.</p>

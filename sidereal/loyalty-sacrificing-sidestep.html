        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By fortunate happenstance, the interests of an attacker and one of the Sidereal&rsquo;s friends coincide, distracting both from the import of the Exalt herself. So sequestered, she is forgotten and unmolested. This Charm may be activated in response to a social attack, but only so long as another valid target that possesses a positive Intimacy or favorable Motivation regarding the Sidereal is within (Essence) yards. Circumstances conspire to make them the target of the social attack in lieu of the Exalt. If the attack is Performance-based, the replacement target&rsquo;s MDV is halved against the attack, as their distracted attention-splitting leaves them more vulnerable even as they prevent the Sidereal from considering and becoming susceptible to the influence.</p>
<p>Sidereals with keen social instincts understand that, though they will give up on their servitude if ill-treated, the limits of a true friend are great indeed. With a Presence 5+ repurchase, a Sidereal may use this Charm to redirect physical attacks and other undesired effects (such as the random mutation of the Wyld or the roaring flames of a bonfire) toward a Familiar or Acquaintance. Each redirected effect counts as a scene eroding any Intimacies of loyalty or friendship that the companion may have for the Exalt. Once all such Intimacies are gone, the companion will tend to resent the Sidereal and may leave or even attack him, but until then they suffer their impressed guardianship without complaint.</p>

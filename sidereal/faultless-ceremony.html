        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In a harmonious universe, the decrees of the Chosen of the Maidens are as mandates from Heaven, never to be deviated from by villain or happenstance. This Charm enhances the act of officiating or performing a social ritual, one that reasonably evokes hope or desire for an associated goal. Examples include an adulthood rite seeking success for the young celebrant, a wedding seeking happiness for the new couple, the beginning of a funeral procession to Sijan, the christening of a new merchant sailing vessel with dreams of good fortune, or a prayer to these same ends (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 132). The roll to officiate the ceremony automatically succeeds if it would otherwise fail, with 0 threshold successes.</p>
<p>So long as the ceremony is carried out successfully, the Exalt and all participants are wrapped up in the inevitability of the beneficiary&rsquo;s good future. They effectively gain the benefits of an appropriate Motivation to fulfill an extrapolated goal of the ceremony: to bring the dead body to Sijan, or to help the young adult succeed in making a name for himself. This allows related stunts to resonate and gain a bonus die, and for those pursuing the goal to regain Willpower when they make progress. This benefit lasts no more than one story, and no character may be caught up in more than one use of this Charm at a time.</p>

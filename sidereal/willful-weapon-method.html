        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal prepares a throwing weapon and looks into the woven pattern of fate that binds her weapon and her target. She makes a throwing motion with her weapon. Rather than the weapon itself, however, she casts the shadow of the weapon at the target. The shadow homes in inexorably on the target at the Sidereal&rsquo;s command—potentially over several attack actions—until the shadow strikes true. When it does so, the shadow is replaced by the actual weapon, which disappears from the Sidereal&rsquo;s hand at last and appears stuck in the target.</p>
<p>The target must be visible to the Sidereal and within the maximum range of her weapon. The Sidereal&rsquo;s player rolls (Dexterity + Thrown), ignoring all external penalties. If the attack misses, the Seer can redirect the shadow weapon on her next action with a subsequent (Dexterity + Thrown) roll. As long as she can still see the target, and her player attempts a Thrown roll every subsequent action, the Sidereal can keep redirecting the shadow weapon until it hits.</p>
<p>Sidereals with Essence 3+ can lend their weapon the official authority to send out messengers of its fate, allowing the actual missile to rest lazily in the Exalt’s hand. By adding +1m to the Charm’s Cost, the Seer throws only the weapon’s shadow, conserving her ammunition.</p>

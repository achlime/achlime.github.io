        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Sidereal faces a choice between options, she can peek into the future to see which choice would bring her the best outcome in the next month. The Charm does not, however, show the consequences of her decision beyond that point. The Charm might show her, for example, which of a range of investment opportunities will yield the greatest short-term dividends but wouldn&rsquo;t reveal that investing her money in that particular venture secretly puts cash in the pocket of the merchant prince whose business practices will destabilize the satrapy&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Wise Choice does not reveal options the Sidereal herself does not consider. For instance, if a Sidereal uses Wise Choice to choose between two paths in a labyrinth, the Charm won&rsquo;t reveal the secret door that provides a third option. The character must also define what sort of outcom she considers optimal: maximum profit, the shortest path or whatever. The Charm always provides a rough estimate of personal danger, though.</p>
<p>Groups of Sidereals can look further into the future. A circle of five Seers, each of a different caste, can use Wise Choice to assess consequences up to a year in the future. Five such circles can consider outcomes 100 years in the future. The entire Five-Score Fellowship can look an Age in the future. The further they look, however, the wider becomes the spread of possibilities, unless truly grand, Creation-wide forces are at work—as they were when the Sidereals pondered what to do about the madness of the Lawgivers. All participants must know Wise Choice to gain the group benefits.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A Sidereal may graciously share his fate with his opponent. Should a Sidereal&rsquo;s Parry or Dodge Defense Value prove insufficient to defend against an enemy&rsquo;s attack, the Sidereal may invoke this Charm to make a Melee-based counterattack, resolved in Step 9 of the initial attack&rsquo;s resolution. Note the rules for counterattacks on <strong>Exalted</strong> pages 150 and 183.</p>
<p>As the Chosen of the Maidens, the Sidereal Exalted are less than fair in dealing with those intrinsically opposed to their purview. Seers may use this Charm in response to attacks that fail to hit them if they come from creatures outside fate.</p>
<p>With Essence 4+, a Sidereal may add +1wp to this Charm’s cost to counter attacks that do not target her, as long as she could otherwise validly respond if she were the target. Any Counterattacks from the true target take precedence and prevent the Sidereal’s counter.</p>
<p>At Essence 6+ the surcharge becomes +0wp to counter on behalf of others when the attacker is a creature outside fate.</p>

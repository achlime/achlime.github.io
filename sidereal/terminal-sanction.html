        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Maidens gave their Chosen a frightening authority over spirits. When a Sidereal activates Terminal Sanction against a present god or elemental, the player rolls (Charisma + Bureaucracy) against a difficulty of the targeted spirit&rsquo;s Essence. Whether this roll succeeds or fails, the spirit must materialize before the Sidereal and remain solid until the end of the scene. If the roll does succeed, the spirit has even more reason to fear the Sidereal. Should the spirit &ldquo;die&rdquo; in that scene, the Sidereal has four choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sidereal can destroy the spirit.</li>
<li>He could bind the spirit to his service—either one task of indefinite duration or general obedience for one year and one day.</li>
<li>He can bind the spirit&rsquo;s Essence into an object, creating an artifact rated at half the spirit&rsquo;s Essence (round up). The Storyteller designs the artifact, based on the powers of the spirit. The artifact lasts only a year and a day, however, before the spirit goes free.</li>
<li>If nothing else, the Sidereal can simply let the spirit reform in its sanctum, knowing full well what the Sidereal <em>could have</em> done to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the terms of the Yozis&rsquo; surrender, this Charm also works against demons of every Circle and adds a number of automatic successes on the (Charisma + Bureaucracy) roll against them equal to the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence. This gives Sidereals a second chance to control demons that escape control.</p>
<p>This Charm has a range of (Essence x 10) yards. Activation of this Charm inflicts an unblockable and undodgeable unnatural Compulsion to materialize. The target is made aware of the Exalt’s presence and distance when affected by this Charm. Binding spirits with it is an irresistible unnatural Servitude. When used to bind demons, it is identical to sorcerous binding, preventing other bindings of the same demon.</p>
<p>With a Bureaucracy 5+, Essence 4+ repurchase, a Sidereal may use this Charm to target multiple spirits at once. By adding +4m to its Cost, the Exalt may compel up to 10 spirits of a certain kind to materialize, and if the roll is successful doom them in the event of their defeat. &ldquo;Kinds&rdquo; of spirits are delineated by the usual types (elemental, god, demon), as well as whether or not they are officially employed by Heaven. An Exalt could compel all Celestial censor elemental dragons to appear, or all unaffiliated elemental dragons, but not both at once. A third purchase at Bureaucracy and Essence 6+ allows the Sidereal to add another +4m to sanction up to (Essence ÷ 2) Magnitude spirits at once.</p>

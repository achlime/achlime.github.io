        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Corruption and vice beset companies of righteous heroes on all sides, but the tricks of Kapula from the far reaches of Chaos or the lies of the Ebon Dragon himself are no match for the mazy reassurances of a Sidereal advisor. This Charm enhances a social group of which the Exalt is a part, as long as he is not the leader. Social attacks targeting the group suffer a -3 external penalty. The Sidereal, acting in his capacity as a Vizier, may perform appropriate stunts to speak out against the offending influence, increasing the penalty by an amount equal to the rating of the stunt.</p>
<p>Multiple Sidereals may better bolster the resolve of a group. Each extra Vizier that activates this Charm increases the base penalty by one, to a maximum additional penalty equal to the lowest permanent Essence amongst them.</p>

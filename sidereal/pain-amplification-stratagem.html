        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Weeping three tears of blood, the Sidereal raises his weapon to wipe them away, smearing it with three lost pangs of sorrow for his foes’ plight. Imbued with this sense of regret, it becomes unthinkable that the weapon should fail in its mission. Thrown attacks using weapons enchanted with this Charm have their target number reduced by the wound penalty that the target is suffering. (If the target has powers that allow it to ignore or reduce wound penalties, Pain Amplification Stratagem uses the lowered wound penalty.) This cannot lower a target number below 4.</p>
<p>If the attack should hit and inflict at least one level of damage, the target is wracked with unbelievable pain, causing them to lose temporary Willpower points equal to their wound penalty (minimum 1). A target reduced to 0 Willpower this way becomes Inactive for five ticks as they writhe in agony.</p>

            <p><strong>The Sidereal&rsquo;s player can invoke this charm whan making a roll based on the relevant Ability</strong>. This Charm then adds one die to that roll for each mote spent. A Sidereal can not have more dice added by Charms than her (Essence). If a Sidereal character suffers a dice-pool penalty, however, she may still spend motes with this Charm to bring her dice pool back up to zero dice before spending an additional number equal to her Essence to add extra dice.</p>
<p>Characters can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability, usually to increase a Defense Value, for example, by increasing (Dexterity + Dodge) to protect against a physical attack. When enhancing static values, her player rolls one die for each mote spent on the First Excellency. Each success increases her effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for the task by two. <strong>Therefore, each success on the First Excellency roll increases an applicable static value by one.</strong></p>
<p>This Charm can be part of a Combo or used together with the Second Excellency, but it is incompatibly with the Third Excellency. It can never be used on the same roll as the Third Excellency.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In the character&rsquo;s sleep, the Maiden of Secrets reveals to him her plan for fate. If the character spends five motes of Essence as he receives this vision, he understands how he fits into this grand plan and what he can do to best integrate himself into the Maiden&rsquo;s efforts. When he wakes, the character has access to three relevant bonus specialties he may divide among up to three Abilities of the Sidereal&rsquo;s choosing. The dice from these specialties may also apply to the effect roll for any Sidereal astrology that involves the college corresponding to a selected Ability.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that characters using this Charm are still limited to a maximum +3 bonus from specialties to any given roll. Also, bonus dice granted from these specialties count as bonus from Charms. The Ability or Abilities the character chooses need not be the same each time the character activates the Methodology of Secrets, but the character cannot change which trait receives the benefit until the next time he sleeps (and uses the Charm again).</p>

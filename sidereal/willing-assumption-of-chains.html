        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Perhaps the greatest power the Maidens give to their Chosen is the power to give a god new responsibilities— and, therefore, a new nature. Yu-Shan holds many gods left beggared and homeless when the Great Contagion and the Fair Folk Invasion destroyed the gods&rsquo; former purviews. The Sidereals sometimes recruit such gods by offering them the chance to become the god of <em>something</em> again.</p>
<p>The Sidereal writes the Scripture of the Maiden in Chains on a prayer strip, signs it and offers it to a target god. The god signs, and the Essence-infused paper vanishes in an emerald flash, to reappear in a certain office at the Bureau of Heaven. The god instantly gains the new office granted by the Vizier (possibly with minor alterations to the god&rsquo;s innate powers if the Storyteller considers this appropriate), but no change in its Attributes or Abilities. Gods empowered by this Charm may, if appropriate, raise their permanent Essence by one to match the stature of their office. Prudent Sidereals choose gods who already have some qualifications for their new posts. For their part, prudent gods ask what sort of duty the Sidereal intends for them before they sign.</p>
<p>The Charm functions only if the recipient deity signs of his own free will. Spirits cannot be directly compelled by unnatural influence to agree to the Charm&rsquo;s terms, but natural influence may still convince them. A Sidereal might pressure a god through threats, but such action is a Severity 5 offense if the Bureau of Heaven notices this infringement on the Bureau&rsquo;s prerogatives.</p>

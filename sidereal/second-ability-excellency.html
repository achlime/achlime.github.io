            <p><strong>The Sidereal&rsquo;s player can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability.</strong> This Charm adds one success to a roll for every two motes spent. Each success purchased with Essence Triumphant is the equivalent of purchasing one dice with the First Excellency or some other dice adder. Sidereals can have nor more dice added by Charms than their (Essence).</p>
<p>The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. Each two motes spent increases his effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for one task by two. <strong>This means that every two motes spent on this Excellency increase a static value like a DV by one.</strong> The First Excellency is thus considerably more efficient for increasing static values than the Second Excellency, but not reliably so.</p>
<p>This Charm can be Comboed or used together with the First Excellency, but it is incompatible with the Third Excellency, and it can never be used on the same roll as the Third Excellency.</p>

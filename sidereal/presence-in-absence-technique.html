        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a touch and an undetectable whisper to the universe, the Sidereal tugs at the fate surrounding a person and lends it such a resonant destiny that others are compelled to fulfill the imposed doom. This Charm &ldquo;hangs&rdquo; a social attack from the Sidereal on a target that must be inside fate, though the social attack validly targets creatures outside of fate. The attack may impose any influence the Exalt can manage normally, compelling behavior or encouraging a belief, but it must do so with a central focus on the presence and actions of the target of the Charm. The weight of their destiny imposes the Sidereal&rsquo;s vision on others.</p>
<p>The social attack triggers and is applied against valid targets, which may include the person on which it hangs, under a set of circumstances decided by the Sidereal when the Charm is activated. This may be as simple as a time delay, or as complex as being present for a meeting between two specific characters. The Charm lapses without effect at the end of the story. No more than one use of this Charm may be in effect on the same target at the same time.</p>

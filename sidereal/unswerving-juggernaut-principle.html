        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Ruby stardust falls from the sky and covers the Sidereal for a moment—and she takes off running. Her eyes focus straight ahead, and her feet keep her course within 10 degrees of her initial heading. While she moves, her soak increases by +5L/+5B, she suffers no fatigue penalties, she needs no sleep and she adds a number of dice equal to her Essence to any Athletics rolls required to make forward progress. (These benefits likewise apply to the character&rsquo;s mount if the character is riding.)</p>
<p>The character must continue to make forward progress, though, lest the Charm end suddenly. She can only run, sprint, jump, swim, ride, use a mobility-enhancing Charm or use the Lesser Sign of Mercury. If the reason for the character&rsquo;s journey changes—if she uses this Charm to flee, for instance, and her pursuers give up the chase—the player receives a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll to notice that circumstances have changed enough that she can end the Charm.</p>

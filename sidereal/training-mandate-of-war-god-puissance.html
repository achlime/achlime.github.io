        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>During the Primordial War, and later the Usurpation, it was necessary to quickly and effectively promote whatever allies the Sidereals could find into full-fledged battle assets. Though the Exalted often subverted many demons, and most gods were their allies, the vast majority were simply not great warriors. This Charm is a dramatic week-long training session with a group of spirits, instructing them in the ways of war and in the auspicious battle plans of Heaven.</p>
<p>The spirits so trained gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>They gain a bonus die on all Archery, Melee and War rolls. While this bonus lasts, they may internalize this lesson to improve their real rating in an Ability as a dramatic month-long Training effect. This cannot raise Abilities to ratings of 5+.</li>
<li>If they lack them, they are temporarily granted First Excellencies in the Abilities of Archery, Dodge, Melee and War.</li>
<li>They gain one temporary iteration of Ox-Body Technique, Essence Plethora, or Principle of Motion, at the Sidereal’s discretion. This cannot grant a spirit more purchases of a Charm than they could normally learn, and while the effect lasts they may permanently learn the Charm as a dramatic month-long Training effect.</li>
<li>While gathered as the majority of a mass combat unit, the spirits may materialize for the duration of a battle if their leader spends 1wp as a Miscellaneous action rallying them across the Chasm of the Material.</li>
<li>They are considered to be full members of the Crimson Panoply of Victory. They are roughly considered to be gods of a rank one less than their personal power might indicate, to a maximum of Third Rank. This affords them the authority to command others with Mandates of Subordination and similar effects.</li>
</ul>

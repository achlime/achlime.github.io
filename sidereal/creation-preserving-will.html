            <p>The Sidereal determination to see the Ending allotted to them by Saturn is so strong, they are empowered to eschew the trials of worlds beyond Creation. This Charm enhances its prerequisite, so that in addition to penalizing any attack it is applied against, it negates undesired Shaping that accompanies it. It may also be applied against effects that are not characterdriven attacks, such as Wyld mutation. Against Shaping from sources outside of fate, the Charm&rsquo;s cost is reduced by 1m; against the Shaping of Sidereal Charms and astrology, it is increased by 1m. This cost variance is considered a special Flaw of Invulnerability.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the Eternal Maiden. As he infuses the prayer strip with Essence, the prayer strip hovers beside him. The air immediately around the character darkens, but the prayer strip glows with bright yellow light.</p>
<p>On the tick she activates this Charm and every action tick thereafter, the Sidereal may commit 3m per target to ensnare others&rsquo; fates until her next action tick. She may not ensnare more than (Essence) targets at once. With their destinies wound together thus, attacks targeting the Sidereal are treated as simultaneously targeting the Exalt&rsquo;s chosen victims normally, even if the attack cannot usually strike more than one target. This occurs in Step 1 of attack resolution. The distributed attack is not made unblockable, undodgeable or unsoakable by this Charm, and any given target&rsquo;s defense against the attack does not save other targets. Targets must be within (Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence x 5) yards of the Exalt to suffer distributed attacks.</p>

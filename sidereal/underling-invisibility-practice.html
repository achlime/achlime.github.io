        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The more important someone is, the more people he has scurrying to do his will. The more such people he has under him, the less distinct they all become, until he barely notices any individual one of them. By internalizing the underlying concept, a Sidereal can wrap himself in that same anonymity and invisibility&hellip; but only against people who consider themselves better than the Sidereal—or at least better than the type of person the Sidereal pretends to be. A person might consider himself personally better than the Sidereal, of higher social class, higher in an organization, or just generally better than everyone.</p>
<p>When a Sidereal encounters such a person while using this Charm, that person cannot notice the Sidereal. The person might notice signs of the Sidereal&rsquo;s passing, such as footprints, but not while the Sidereal is present. It doesn&rsquo;t help if other people, who can see the Sidereal, point her out; the arrogant victim just doesn&rsquo;t pay attention. At most, the Sidereal leaves a faint impression based on her caste. Chosen of Journeys give the victim a sense that he needs to be someplace else. Chosen of Serenity make the victim feel happy or peaceful. Chosen of Battles make the victim tense and wary. Chosen of Secrets give the victim a sense of déjà vu. Chosen of Endings leave a vague sense of anxiety and futility. This Charm can be ignored by spending 3wp. This Charm will lapse like a Stealth Charm when the Sidereal’s anima flares too high.</p>
<p>Effects that grant a perfect counter to invisibility pierce this effect; though as a form of unnatural Illusion, this Charm is not defeated by powers that pierce conventional invisibility. This Charm&rsquo;s glaring flaw—although Sidereals don&rsquo;t consider it such—is that it does not affect other Sidereals. A Vizier in the guise of a Guild merchant could follow the barbarian Bull of the North unnoticed from hell to breakfast, but any effort to sneak past his Sidereal field supervisor in Yu-Shan to drop off a late report would be doomed to failure.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip on which is written the Scripture of the Maiden Entombed. The Essence-infused paper flutters in the air next to the character, trailing golden sparkles like a congregation of admiring fireflies.</p>
<p>While this Charm is active, the Sidereal becomes the master of an area of wilderness with a radius of (Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence) miles. As long as the character can see his prayer strip, he remains aware of anyone of interest to him in the affected area. (If creatures of interest use powers that render themselves immune to mundane tracking, the Sidereal must employ other supernatural means of awareness to track them.)</p>
<p>The Seer&rsquo;s command of the wild can grant anyone he chooses three automatic successes on all Survival rolls in the area or reduce an enemy&rsquo;s Survival rolls by the same amount. Affecting others thus forces the Sidereal to commit two more motes per person.</p>
<p>This Charm provides the following benefits while the Exalt stares at the prayer strip:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sidereal can make valid rolls to perceive the area as if he were present throughout it.</li>
<li>He may target perceived animals within the area with his Manipulation-based social attacks as long as he enhances the attack with <a class="complex" href="adopting-the-untamed-face.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Adopting the Untamed Face'"><span class="link-focus">Adopting the Untamed Face</span></a>. He conveys his message through environment and scenery rather than words.</li>
<li>The Exalt may use Dreaming the Wild Lands, increasing its range to encompass the area. Small changes, such as using the Charm to create hazard attacks, do not cost Willpower.</li>
<li>Once per day, the Exalt may activate <a class="complex" href="sky-and-rain-mantra.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Sky and Rain Mantra'"><span class="link-focus">Sky and Rain Mantra</span></a> at a discounted 0m Cost (Willpower surcharges apply normally for extreme weather).</li>
<li>The number of successes or amount of external penalty the Exalt imposes on others’ Survival and Resistance rolls to live in the area can range from 1 to 3. He may also, at his choice, pay 1wp to grant a target the benefits of <a class="complex" href="becoming-the-wilderness.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Becoming the Wilderness'"><span class="link-focus">Becoming the Wilderness</span></a> for one day within the area.</li>
</ul>

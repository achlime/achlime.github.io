        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Through subtle adjustments to her manner of speaking, the Sidereal makes her statements seem laden with implications that listeners find too horrible or absurd to believe. The Charm supplements social actions using any Ability (and can be part of a Combo with any ability&rsquo;s Charms), but changes the effect of the social action.</p>
<p>This Charm enhances social attacks to encourage beliefs. It adds (Essence) successes to the attack, which is compared against the target’s Parry or Dodge MDV normally. Success imposes the unnatural Illusion that what the Exalt said is untrue, even if the target would normally believe otherwise. It costs 3wp to ignore this influence. The Charm can also be employed to enhance truths and lies outside of social combat. The target thinks he saw through the Sidereal&rsquo;s &ldquo;lie&rdquo; and believes that whatever she said isn&rsquo;t true. This may cause the victim to discount other people who sincerely make similar claims; or when the victim discovers that the Sidereal&rsquo;s &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; statement was true after all, he might be inclined to believe a genuine whopper from the Sidereal.</p>
<p>When someone attempts to tell if the character is lying or not (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 131), the difficulty to do so is raised by the Exalt’s Essence. Failure to see through the Sidereal’s facade imposes this Charm’s influence on the observer.</p>
<p><em>Example: Ayesha Ura—concealed by a resplendent destiny as a humble farmer&rsquo;s wife—tells Peleps Deled that Anathema have terrorized the area. She uses Avoiding the Truth Technique while saying this. Since Ayesha wants to persuade Deled, her player rolls (Manipulation + Presence), channels a Willpower through her Conviction (Deled is well-known as a strong-willed man) and adds Ayesha&rsquo;s Larceny in automatic successes. The result just barely overcomes the Dynast&rsquo;s Dodge Mental Defense Value. Deled thinks the &ldquo;farmwife&rdquo; is a flibbertigibbet who sees Anathema in every shadow. Thus, the fanatical Immaculate immediately decides the lead that brought him after a suspected Solar was a hoax, and his Wyld Hunt rides away.</em></p>

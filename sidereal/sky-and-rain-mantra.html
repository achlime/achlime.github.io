        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The character can knot up the destinies of the wind and sky in a region, controlling its weather to aid or hinder others. The Vizier&rsquo;s player spends the motes and rolls (Stamina + Survival). Each success adds +1 to the difficulty of other characters&rsquo; Survival or Resistance rolls to live in the affected area. (The player can apply fewer successes than rolled.) The harsh weather lasts for one whole day and affects an area with a maximum radius of (Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence) miles. The nature of this harsh weather depends on the surroundings. It can be unseasonable for the region (such as torrential downpour in the dry season) but not freakish (such as a blizzard howling across the Southern deserts). This Charm cannot directly cause environmental hazards that inflict damage. The Sidereal cannot create a firestorm or deadly cold, but a bout of unseasonable warmth may lead to a forest fire naturally.</p>
<p>If the Sidereal is so inclined, he can also use this Charm to alleviate harsh (natural) weather conditions. A single success on the (Stamina + Survival) roll calms the weather in the affected area. One success might be enough to counter some forms of deprivation, such as creating rain to help characters who suffer from thirst. In other cases, the Storyteller might reduce weather-related difficulties of or penalties to Survival or Resistance rolls by the number of successes rolled. If two characters attempt to use this Charm to opposing ends in the same overlapping area, the roll is contested.</p>
<p>With Survival 5+ and Essence 3+, a Sidereal may use this Charm to create ‘freakish’ changes in weather, such as blizzards in the South. This increases the Cost of the Charm by +1wp, and its enforced Duration lasts for only an hour. With Survival 5+ and Essence 4+, a Sidereal’s use of this Charm can cause weather that is a natural environmental hazard, on the level of the blistering heat/numbing cold described on <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 131 normally. By adding +1wp to the Charm’s Cost and reducing its Duration to One hour, more extreme weather on the level of severe sandstorms is possible. Creating hazards this way increases the difficulty of the roll to activate the Charm by +2.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The character weaves a net of destiny with filaments thinner than spiderweb, yet stronger than malice, and casts the net over any target the character can see. Doing so requires a successful (Dexterity + Lore) roll, with a difficulty equal to the target&rsquo;s Essence. The invisible net adheres to the target, exerting a subtle gravity on the world around the target. Normally, this effect lasts for one year and one day, but if the Sidereal spent a permanent dot of Willpower, the effect lasts for as long as it must in order to fulfill its purpose.</p>
<p>Thereafter, in a circumstance the Sidereal chose when she performed this Charm, every dice pool that directly opposes the target of the net enjoys a -1 target number reduction (to a minimum of 4). This curse upon the target lasts for one scene. Multiple nets can affect the same victim, but only if they come from different characters and have different triggering circumstances. The net cannot adhere to Incarnae, or to Yozis, Neverborn and other transcendent entities.</p>
<p>The resemblance to Sidereal astrology is, of course, obvious. Of Horrors Best Unknown gives the Five-Score Fellowship one means to affect the fates of entities from beyond Creation, albeit possibly at a high price. The mystic net also has a little-known but even greater function: if a targeted creature from outside fate sacrifices a dot of Willpower, the Charm permanently binds the creature to the Loom; the creature is no longer outside of fate, though the creature retains all its former powers.</p>
<p>To clarify, this Charm brings creatures outside of fate inside of fate for a year and a day, while its &ldquo;Target Number&rdquo;-modifying curse lasts only for the first scene in which the net&rsquo;s criteria are met.</p>

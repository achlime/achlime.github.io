        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal enfolds her heart in a pocket of emptiness that separates her heart from Creation. When she does so, she dispenses with the need to breathe, eat or drink, as well as her normal susceptibility to disease, poison, degenerative effects, temperature extremes or exposure. While her heart remains hidden, she suffers no penalties resulting from adverse environmental conditions or impairments to normal body function. Fatigue penalties (from exertion or armor) no longer bother her. She cannot be knocked unconscious. She still suffers damage as normal, but does not take wound penalties. Even if damage ought to Incapacitate her, she functions as if nothing is wrong. Seeing foes hacking away at her with axes or perforating her with frog-crotch arrows might convince her that a tactical retreat is wise, but if her determination overrides her better judgment, she can stay in the fight until she drops dead.</p>
<p>Until the Sidereal restores her heart to its place, she cannot regain Essence except through Charms. When she does restore her heart, any poisons, diseases, fatigue penalties, deprivation penalties, environmental conditions (if she&rsquo;s in the same environment) or wounds she accrued while her heart was away kick in all at once as if she were first exposed to them the moment the Charm&rsquo;s duration ended. To clarify, the Sidereal ignores all internal penalties from the listed sources. She does not ignore penalties from environmental conditions such as unstable footing.</p>

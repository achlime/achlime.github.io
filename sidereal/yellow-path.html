        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A character with a destination in mind asks the Maiden of Journeys for her best advice on arriving there. The player then rolls his character’s Essence. For one success, the Maiden shows the Seer a path that enables him to reach his destination in three-quarters of the time it would normally take him based on travel type and distance. (See the chart on p. 264 of <strong>Exalted</strong>.) If the character points out that he has a deadline to keep (and the player rolls three successes), Mercury illuminates any means that might exist to get the character there under normal travel conditions. (The character might have to run for three hours straight, bribe a courier in an elaborate horse relay system to give up his mount, gallop all the way to the coast and finally board a hard-rowing ocean vessel, but he’ll make his appointment.) If the player rolls five successes and the character has a deadline to beat, the Maiden of Journeys reveals to him a miraculous path that will get the Seer to his destination ahead of his deadline no matter how far away it is and how little time remains.</p>
<p>The deadlines a character rushes to meet with the assistance of this Charm must actually exist. She cannot arbitrarily invent or declare deadlines for herself. For example, a Vizier might hurry across Creation to reach Nexus in time for her brother’s birthday if she intends to pay him a surprise visit upon arriving, but could not do so simply because she wishes to use the Nexus gateway to get back to Yu-Shan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The paths revealed by this Charm aren’t guaranteed to be free of danger to the Sidereal, but will not lead her into certain doom. Miraculous paths revealed by rolling 5+ successes allow the Sidereal to bypass limitations of distance, but not of active obstruction; for example, an attempt to divine a path to the heart of the Imperial Manse would quickly deposit a Sidereal at the entrance to the structure, at which point it would be up to her to find some way to breach its formidable defenses.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm can temporarily transform the Sidereal into someone else entirely. To activate it, the Sidereal infuses Essence into a prayer strip of the Scripture of Absence. The prayer strip flashes dark green, then slithers beneath the Seer&rsquo;s ribcage to wrap around her heart. As the strip cinches tight, the Sidereal vanishes from her current location and reappears someplace else in a completely different identity that is seamlessly integrated into the local community. Any effect that was based on the Sidereal&rsquo;s old identity fails automatically. Memories of the Sidereal&rsquo;s old identity do not fade away— except as determined by the vagaries of Arcane Fate—but the person with that identity no longer seems to exist.</p>
<p>In the instant when one identity vanishes, the Sidereal reflexively assumes a new one somewhere else in Creation. This identity can be mortal, Exalted, god, elemental, ghost or half-breed—any sentient creature from within fate&rsquo;s purview, whose Essence does not exceed the Seer&rsquo;s own. The Sidereal cannot take on the identity of someone who actually exists or existed. The Maidens (and the Storyteller) decide where the character appears, but the Vizier (and her player) can select an identity suitable to the new location—assuming her superiors in the Bureau of Destiny do not assign one.</p>
<p>In her new identity, the character retains all of her Attributes and Abilities but gains up to 15 dots of Backgrounds appropriate to her new identity. (Backgrounds above three dots cost two dots each.) Her old Backgrounds no longer apply. As the Vizier appears in her new location, a network of appropriate social contacts and relationships immediately weaves itself into being as if this new identity had existed among the locals all along. Only creatures of the Wyld, beings outside fate and spirits at or above the Maidens&rsquo; level of power and authority are not fooled by this extemporaneously woven identity. The disguise draped around the Sidereal herself is Shaping of an impenetrable nature. Community members who should know the new persona, and social attacks to convince others that the persona is real, are subject to or become unnatural Illusions that cost 3wp to ignore.</p>
<p>Just as Attributes and Abilities, the character retains all of her Charms and spells, as well as her normal anima effects. If the character is known as an Exalt (of whatever type) among the locals, those witnesses understand the Sidereal&rsquo;s powers as being appropriate to an Exalt of the type they assume she is. If the character&rsquo;s supernatural powers, or all-too-human ignorance, should betray the fact that she doesn&rsquo;t belong, the character automatically receives a perfect success on a social roll to explain the matter in a way that makes perfect sense to the audience. (&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s not an Anathema. That&rsquo;s just a special Southern variant of the Air Dragon Style of the Immaculate martial arts she was apparently doing. I guess we don&rsquo;t have to get the Magistrate involved. Good thing she said something.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>If the Sidereal ends the Charm intentionally or spends more than 10 motes of peripheral Essence in a scene, the Charm ends. Its effects otherwise linger for five days, at which point the Sidereal coughs up the scraps of her prayer strip in a cloud of confetti and disappears from her false identity. She returns to her previous identity in the place that identity considers home.</p>

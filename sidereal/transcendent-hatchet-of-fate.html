        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Sidereal pours her Essence into a prayer strip of the Scripture of the Maiden in Terror, the prayer strip glows a hideous green, then twists itself up and disappears into her palm like a worm burrowing into her flesh (the only Obvious aspect of the Charm). All that remains is a faint impression of the words of the scripture.</p>
<p>At a time of the Sidereal&rsquo;s choosing, she can reveal the scripture to a single victim and name that victim&rsquo;s unpleasant fate. The Sidereal&rsquo;s player rolls (Intelligence + Lore) as the character describes to her victim how the victim&rsquo;s worst fear is, in fact, written into his destiny. The victim immediately loses a number of Willpower points and motes of Essence equal to the Sidereal&rsquo;s Essence plus the successes on the roll. (This effect reduces the affected pools to a minimum of zero.)</p>
<p>Worse yet, the Sidereal&rsquo;s proclamation of the victim&rsquo;s fate—designed in narrative terms by the player, with the Storyteller&rsquo;s approval—is guaranteed in the victim&rsquo;s destiny. His fate might not play out immediately, or quite the way the Sidereal expects, but as long as no one tampers with the Loom of Fate or invites the interference of creatures outside of fate, the victim&rsquo;s destiny will come to pass in the his lifetime.</p>
<p>This Charm is a Shaping attack that cannot be blocked or dodged. Even if a character avoids the loss of Willpower and motes, they still know their doom.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Activating this Charm, the Sidereal throws into the air a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden&rsquo;s Promise. It hangs for a second, before glowing an arrogant purple and darting about within 100 yards of the Exalt, seeking the best route to the end of his destiny. The Seer defers his name and any claim he has to a life beyond his ultimate purpose, setting them aside as collateral so that the prayer strip can invigorate him and drag him along toward his doom. His identity forgotten by the world, whether he wears a resplendent destiny or not all who meet him are subject to Arcane Fate regarding memories of him, even those who are outside fate or otherwise immune to Arcane Fate normally, such as other Sidereals. This can be avoided temporarily by stealing a name with <a class="complex" href="name-pilfering-practice.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Name-Pilfering Practice'"><span class="link-focus">Name-Pilfering Practice</span></a> (see page 73), but only so long as he acts the part of the stolen name.</p>
<p>When an Exalt activates this Charm, he must choose a goal, which then nests in his heart in place of his name. This grants him a sorcerous Intimacy of unceasing dedication to the goal, which cannot be removed by any means. Influence opposing the goal is an unacceptable order. He suffers a -2 internal penalty on actions unrelated to the goal, and a -5 internal penalty on actions contrary to the goal. None of the Exalt&rsquo;s own Charms or other powers can overcome these penalties; he cannot ignore them.</p>
<p>As recompense, the character gains an extra success on all actions that further the completion of the goal. He ignores any wound or fatigue penalties on actions that are not contrary to the goal, even to the point of continuing to act when he should be unconscious. When performing a stunt that would resonate with the Intimacy if it were a Motivation, the Sidereal converts the stunt&rsquo;s bonus dice into automatic successes, and may as his stunt reward choose to heal one lethal health level of damage or three bashing levels.</p>
<p>When the Exalt&rsquo;s goal is completed, his name is returned to him as One Direction Invocation ends. This Charm can be ended prematurely, but if so the Exalt&rsquo;s name is not returned; he will need to go to some effort to acquire a new one, often with the aid of relevant gods or other magical authorities. As long as he lacks a name, he is subject to the universal Arcane Fate imposed by use of this Charm. A character without a name cannot reactivate this Charm, even if he steals a replacement.</p>

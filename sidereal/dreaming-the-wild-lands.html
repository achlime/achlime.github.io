        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Sidereal learns to bend the wilderness to her will. He can make minor changes in the scenery, such as moving a tree, changing a bend in a river or re-sculpting the jumbled aftermath of a rockslide. A character can use this Charm to attack using elements of the landscape, such as dropping boulders from a cliff or a wasp&rsquo;s nest from a tree, or making a river-bank crumble to pitch an enemy into the water.</p>
<p>This Charm allows the Sidereal to shift any discrete piece of non-magical, untamed wilderness scenery, even important and ‘permanent’ landmarks like glaciers. The Exalt may move a tree, a grove of trees, a clearing in a forest, or even the whole forest if it is small enough. The target scenery and its destination must both be within (Essence x 50) yards of the Sidereal. Any other intertwined elements of scenery will stay where they are, and after the shift is complete both fit as naturally as they can into their new homes. Moving ‘a plain’ or ‘a clearing’ will cause the empty space to be filled with appropriate new scenery of negligible Resources value.</p>
<p>If the targeted piece of scenery is larger than (Essence x 2) yards, it takes about an hour to make the transition, during which time it is not immune to further use of this Charm by an indecisive Sidereal or his competitors.</p>
<p>Pieces of scenery that are up to (Essence x 2) yards travel in the course of a single tick, and may be used to make attacks. The Sidereal subjects those within the targeted area to an environmental hazard with (Essence) Trauma and Damage. It will tend to inflict bashing damage, though it may be lethal at the Storyteller’s discretion based on the scenery used in the attack. These attacks tend to be Instant, but appropriate stunts may extend their effect or cause other hazards, as when the movement of a rock face causes a larger, natural avalanche.</p>
<p>A Sidereal may use this Charm to perform sabotage on or to engineer demesnes (see <strong>The Books of Sorcery, Vol. III— Oadenol’s Codex</strong>, p. 51-54). In the former case, each use of the Charm is equivalent to a week’s worth of sabotage, while in the latter it is equivalent to a month’s worth of labor. This does allow the Exalt to ignore the need for a labor pool or tools, but she must still meet all the other requirements for manipulating a demesene. Remember that landscaping isn’t the only or even most appropriate way to engineer particular types of demesnes.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Postponing her sacrifice so that she might continue to serve Creation, the Sidereal flicks her thumb across the strand of her lifespan, deferring all efforts to cut it. Optimistic Security Practice adds (Essence) to the Sidereal&rsquo;s bashing, lethal, and aggravated soak. If she is not wearing any armor, this rises to her (Essence + Resistance).</p>
<p>In addition, the Sidereal winds the destiny of (her Compassion - target&rsquo;s Compassion, minimum one) of each of her opponents&rsquo; positive Intimacies around her own. When attacked, the Sidereal may interpose the likeness of one of the target&rsquo;s Intimacies over her own like a spectral hostage, its eyes pained by shock and incomprehension at the target&rsquo;s betrayal. The target must pay one Willpower to attack the Sidereal through the figure of his Intimacy; failing to do so causes the attack to sever the thread of that Intimacy, discarding it from the attacker&rsquo;s Intimacies completely. The Sidereal gains the benefit of this defense against any opponent who attacks her until each of that opponent&rsquo;s captured Intimacies have been destroyed, or until the opponent has spent (Sidereal&rsquo;s Compassion) Willpower to resist. The Sidereal may not capture more than five Intimacies of any target per scene, and if two Sidereals capture the same Intimacy, the defense is no longer applicable once that Intimacy has been severed. This Charm does not allow the Sidereal a survey of the target&rsquo;s Intimacies; which Intimacies are captured are determined by the Storyteller, but the Charm generally snares those Intimacies the target considers most important first.</p>

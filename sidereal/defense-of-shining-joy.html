        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Moving with the tempo of her opponent&rsquo;s actions, as if the two of them were lifelong dance partners, the Sidereal can predict the perfect completion of any attack that opponent launches. She can also make certain that this perfect completion does not involve her. For the rest of the scene, may use the higher of her Dodge or Performance to calculate her Dodge Defense Value.</p>
<p>Also, the character can use either her Performance or Dodge Excellencies (but not both) to increase her Dodge Defense Value static value. This new Defense Value ignores up to (Performance) points worth of penalties to her Dodge DV, from any source, apart from penalties from her own actions which are ignored separately. If the Sidereal is protecting someone with a Defend Other action, she may apply this benefit to both her own and her ward&rsquo;s DVs, even when parrying.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Dragon-Blood can summon throwing weapons out of thin air, fashioning them from the element to which she is aligned. Most commonly, the Charm summons throwing daggers, but some Dragon-Blooded summon more personalized weapons, such as shuriken, chakrams or throwing axes. For every 3m spent during activation, the Charm creates one elemental weapon with the normal statistics of its kind that is clearly formed of the appropriate aspect Essence.</p>
<p>The Dragon-Blood can create up to (his Essence) weapons at a time. Repeated activation of this Charm stacks to produce more weapons, but the Exalt cannot create more than (Essence rating) weapons among all activations. These weapons may be given to others, and vanish into nothingness if thrown at their creator or used for any purpose other than throwing them at a target. When thrown, they ignore all multiple action penalties that apply to the attack roll and impose elemental effects as explained below, but vanish after hitting.</p>
<p>Additionally, the weapons summoned have special properties based on the elemental alignment of their creator: Air blades buffet the target, subtracting two dice from her next action. Earth blades knock the target back, forcing her player to roll (Dexterity + Athletics), difficulty 4, to keep the character from falling. Fire sets the target ablaze for an action for an additional 4L. Water fills the target’s lungs with seawater, adding three ticks before her next action due to violent coughing. Wood poisons the target, requiring her player to successfully roll (Stamina + Resistance) at a difficulty of (the DragonBlood’s Essence) to avoid suffering a -1 penalty to all actions for the rest of the scene. (Subsequent successful uses of this poison effect are cumulative.) In order to inflict any of these penalties, the Dragon-Blood must successfully hit his target. He cannot inflict a particular elemental effect more than once per action, however, regardless of how many blades he throws at his target as part of a flurry.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be an Air-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies Additional purchases of this Charm each add another element to the Exalt’s repertoire beyond that of his aspect, but a created weapon can have only one element imbued in it.</p>

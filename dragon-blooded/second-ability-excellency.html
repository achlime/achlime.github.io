            <p><strong>The Dragon-Blood can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability.</strong> The Exalt can spend up to (Ability + applicable specialties) in motes. <strong>The Charm adds one automatic success to the roll for every two motes spent.</strong> If the Dragon-Blood uses Essence Triumphant in combination with Charms that add dice, each success purchased with Essence Triumphant reduces by two the maximum number of dice that she can add.</p>
<p>The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. For every two motes spent, the Dragon-Blood can increase the applicable DV by one, up to a maximum improvement equal to her Ability trait plus any applicable specialties.</p>
<p><strong>This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. The Dragon-Blood, however, is limited in using the Charm as follows: The Charm can be used to purchases automatic success on any action made on the tick in which the Dragon-Blood takes a normal action. On the ticks between actions, this Charm can be used only to enhance an unrolled use of the relevant Ability to improve a DV or to add dice to an Ability used in a Counterattack Charm. This Charm can not, for example, be used to purchase automatic successes between actions to be used for extra attacks.</strong></p>

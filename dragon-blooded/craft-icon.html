        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>To the savants of the Dragon-Blooded, the efficiency with which information can be conveyed is almost as valuable as the information itself. With this Charm, an Air Aspect can convey complex information or directives to another with what appear to be only simple pictograms. In fact, the drawings are actually a complex arrangement of sigils that can contain surprisingly large amounts of information in a very dense package, from complex instructions for assembling a sophisticated piece of First Age technology to exacting directions revealing a hidden location.</p>
<p>For the character to employ this Charm, the player must roll (Manipulation + Linguistics) at a difficulty of 2. Successes above this difficulty determine the level of complexity encoded into the pictogram, with each success over the threshold providing the equivalent of one minute of careful instruction that can be obtained through later study of the pictogram. The icon can be drawn or carved into any media the creator wishes, but doing so requires the expenditure of Essence. As a result, no one else can reproduce the icon without another application of this Charm or a similar one. Icons created with this Charm are about two square inches in size per success.</p>

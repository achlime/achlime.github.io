        <div class="topic-text">
            <p><strong>The Dragon-Blooded can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability. The Charm adds two dice to the roll for each mote spent.</strong> The maximum number of dice that can be added to any one roll, however, is equal to the Dragon-Blood&rsquo;s Ability rating plus any applicable specialty. The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. The player rolls one die for every mote spent, up to a maximum number of dice equal to the relevant Ability plus any applicable specialties. <strong>Each success on the roll increases the applicable DV by one.</strong></p>
<p>Characters cannot use this or other Excellencies or dice-adding Charms to &ldquo;create&rdquo; actions. For example, if a character attacks on tick 3 and will attack again on tick 8, she cannot buy dice for an attack on tick 4 that only exists because she used the Excellency to conjure dice for it. Yet a character who uses this or other reflexive Charms to add to an attack can also use it to enhance her defense until the next tick when she acts, but she must spend Essence for each separate roll she wishes to modify.</p>
<p><strong>This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. The Dragon-Blood, however, is limited in using the Charm as follows: The Charm can be used to add dice to any Ability on the tick in which the Dragon-Blood acts. On the ticks between actions, this Charm can only be used to enhance unrolled uses of the Ability to increase an applicable DV or to add dice to an Ability used in a Counterattack Charm. This Charm can not, for example, be used to purchase Melee dice between actions to be used for extra attacks.</strong></p>

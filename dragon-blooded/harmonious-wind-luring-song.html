            <p>This charm is flagged because of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defines additional charm: This charm also defines Seven Seas Wind-Luring Chanty with different mins and prerequisite</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Of all the spirit courts, the Air Aspects, have the greatest affinity for the courts of the sky. This Charm calls upon that elemental affinity to allow the Dragon-Blooded to invoke the power of the air spirits to summon a helpful wind. The wind summoned is not particularly strong, but it is powerful enough to interfere with Archery, adding half the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence to his DV against archery attacks. It is also powerful enough to affect the speed of a sailing ship. When using this Charm to speed or slow a vehicle propelled by the wind (such as a ship or airboat with sails), the net modifier to per tick speed is the Exalt&rsquo;s (Sail + Essence) and this is applied after any adjustments to the vehicle&rsquo;s own speed. The Air Aspect must spend about five minutes invoking the power of air spirits, usually through such activities as whistling, imitating the sounds of storms, whirling a bullroarer or simply playing a flute. This Charm does not summon an actual spirit, but rather invokes the power of such beings to create winds that may blow anywhere within a radius of (Occult x 100) yards around the Terrestrial. Multiple currents can blow in different directions within the radius, typically to help allies while hindering enemies. Changing the wind&rsquo;s direction or rearranging where it blows within the permitted radius is a diceless miscellaneous action.</p>
<p>Water-aspected Dragon-Bloods have access to a functionally identical Sail Charm called Seven Seas Wind-Luring Chanty. The only differences between the two Charms are that the Water aspect version requires Sail 2 instead of Occult 2, has Hurricane-Predicting Glance as a prerequisite Charm in place of Spirit-Detecting Mirror Technique and requires the Exalt to be at sea.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The two greatest strengths of the Dragon-Blooded have always been their superior numbers and their boundless capacity for teamwork. In the First Age, the Terrestrial Exalted were the unit commanders who led troops into battle under the direction of Celestial generals. In the modern era, Dragon-Blooded retain the capacity to elevate the mortals around them to greatness, if only temporarily. A Dragon-Blood with this Charm can improve the ratings of his allies in the relevant Ability for brief periods of time, effectively transferring the benefits of the First Excellency to another person for the duration of an entire scene. All allies to be affected must hold hands at the time of the Charm&rsquo;s activation. No contact is required to target a fellow officer.</p>
<p>The Dragon-Blood must spend one mote for every ally to be augmented and one mote for every two dice that are added to each person&rsquo;s rating in the relevant Ability. The maximum number of allies who can have their Ability ratings boosted at one time is equal to the Dragon-Blood&rsquo;s permanent Essence. The Charm has two limitations. First, no ally&rsquo;s Ability rating can be raised above the Ability rating of the Exalt who invokes this Charm. Second, no ally&rsquo;s Ability rating can be increased to more than twice its normal rating. Therefore, the ally must have at least one dot in the Ability for this Charm to affect him at all. Exalted fellow officers may have Abilities raised higher than twice their rating (but still no higher than the donor&rsquo;s rating). The extra Ability dots apply for an entire scene for all purposes. If the augmented Ability affects one of the ally&rsquo;s DV ratings, the relevant DV should be recalculated for the duration of the scene. As is normal for dice-adding Charms, fractional motes left over by pool-size restrictions are lost.</p>
<p>With Essence 4+, targeting an Exalted unit leader and committing additional motes equal to the unit&rsquo;s Magnitude simultaneously applies the Charm to every member of the unit. Only Exalted fellow officers ignore the twice rating cap for a unit blessing, but boosting rank and file can increase the unit&rsquo;s Close Combat Rating or Ranged Combat Rating.</p>

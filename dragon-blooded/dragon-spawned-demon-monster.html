            <p>Terrestrial akuma achieve greatness their former peers cannot imagine. Through Infernal Monster Style, fallen Dragon- Blooded become incarnate natural disasters. Dragon-Spawned Demon-Monster is solely Native to Terrestrial akuma and can&rsquo;t be learned by other beings. It provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The akuma is not obligated to attack his Yozi master or any of its component Third Circle demons while in a berserk state (such as that induced by <a class="complex" href="../martial-arts/retribution-will-follow.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Retribution Will Follow'"><span class="link-focus">Retribution Will Follow</span></a>) unless said entities physically attacked him earlier in the scene.</li>
<li>Weapons of elemental energy created by Terrestrial Charms are considered form weapons for Infernal Monster Style (e.g. <a class="complex unresolved" title="Unresolved text body link"><span class="link-focus">Refining the Inner Blade</span></a>). If such Charms have the Holy keyword, they permanently lose their special benefits against creatures of darkness and cease to be Holy. If this results in a Charm that doesn&rsquo;t make sense, the Storyteller should exclude that Charm from conversion.</li>
<li>Instant-duration Terrestrial Charms that damage targets through direct exposure to elemental energy are also considered form weapons for Infernal Monster Style (e.g. <a class="complex" href="elemental-bolt-attack.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Elemental Bolt Attack'"><span class="link-focus">Elemental Bolt Attack</span></a>). If such Charms are Holy, they are converted as previously explained. The akuma may also choose for such attacks to emerge from his mouth like the breath of a dragon.</li>

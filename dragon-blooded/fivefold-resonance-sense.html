        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm is most often used by independent surveyors and the professional jade sniffers of the Thousand Scales. For the duration of the Charm, the Dragon-Blood can detect the presence of jade within a radius of (Essence x 200) yards. If the jade to be detected is elementally aspected with the Dragon-Blood, no roll is required. If the jade is of a different aspect, the Exalt&rsquo;s player must roll (Perception + Occult) at a difficulty of 3. If the Dragon-Blood has an Occult rating of 3 and an Essence of 2, he can also detect other magical materials at a difficulty of 3, but only at a range of (Essence x 50) yards.</p>
<p>This Charm cannot be used to perceive magical materials that are already attuned to someone else, nor can it be used to detect any quantity of such materials that are being concealed through the use of Celestial or Solar level magic, including Charms or spells. If Terrestrial magic is being used to conceal the material, the Dragon-Blood&rsquo;s player must garner more successes on the (Perception + Occult) roll than successes on the roll made to conceal the material or the Essence of the character using the concealing magic (whichever is higher).</p>
<p>Once the Exalt has (Occult 4+, Essence 3+), this Charm can detect artifacts and other objects made of detectable magical materials that are attuned to someone else, but any such items carried by their owner are considered to be concealed by any magic that conceals said owner. With (Occult 5+, Essence 3+), the Charm is no longer automatically trumped by Celestial or Solar magic and just uses roll-off rules when confronted with concealing magic.</p>

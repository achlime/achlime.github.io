        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Children of Mela are renowned for their skill with thrown weapons, a puissance that makes such weapons seem to come alive in their hands. When the Dragon-Blood throws a weapon (including a thrown melee weapon) and activates this Charm, an invisible ribbon of air is attached to it, allowing the Exalt to summon it back to her hand when its path is spent. Whether the weapon strikes its target or not, it will immediately return to the Exalt and be available for reuse on her next regular action. Thrown weapons still attack with their normal Speed, however, and the weapon will not be available for any reflexive uses between the ticks upon which the Dragon-Blooded normally acts. Anyone in the path of the returning weapon can attempt to pluck it out of the air, but doing so requires a successful (Dexterity + Athletics) roll, followed by an immediate reflexive opposed (Strength + Athletics) roll against the player of the weapon’s owner. If the person attempting to snatch the weapon fails on either of these two rolls, the weapon is unimpeded on its return journey.</p>
<p>If this Charm is used to retrieve a weapon that only exists in the moment of the attack (such as <a class="complex" href="elemental-bolt-attack.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Elemental Bolt Attack'"><span class="link-focus">Elemental Bolt Attack</span></a> or <a class="complex" href="deadly-blades-of-the-five-dragons.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Deadly Blades of the Five Dragons'"><span class="link-focus">Deadly Blades of the Five Dragons</span></a>), the projectile continues to exist with the same statistics and returns to the Exalt’s hand so that it may be hurled again without requiring reactivation of the effect that created it. Unless Loyal Weapon is applied again, such projectiles then disappear like normal.</p>

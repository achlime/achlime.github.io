        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The unearthly control of the Air Aspects over their throwing weapons continues to improve with this Charm. After the Dragon-Blood throws a weapon at a target, the weapon takes on a life of its own and continues to make extra attacks. The number of extra attacks is equal to the Exalt’s permanent Essence, and each attack has the normal Speed for that particular weapon for determining the ticks upon which subsequent attacks occur. The attack roll made for the weapon is equal to the Dragon-Blood’s (Perception + Thrown) pool. The Dragon-Blood can perform any other actions he desires as the weapon’s independent attacks proceed, including using this Charm again on the same target with additional throwing weapons. The player must declare that he is invoking this Charm before rolling the first attack, and the target of the weapon cannot be changed during the Charm’s duration. The target (or anyone else) can attempt to strike the weapon out of the air. Doing so requires an attack roll against a difficulty equal to the Dragon-Blood’s permanent Essence. If this attack roll is successful, the weapon is knocked to the ground, where it will rest inert. If a character uses this Charm as part of a Combo, he must pay the Essence cost for the other Charms each time the weapon uses them, and the additional Charms must be used on each attack made. The Exalt needs to pay the Willpower cost of the Combo only once, though. The Loyal Weapon Charm is an exception to this rule, and if Loyal Weapon is put in a Combo with Persistent Hornet Attack, the weapon will make all of its requisite attacks and only then return to the Exalt. The Essence for the Loyal Weapon Charm needs to be paid only once.</p>
<p>The Charm’s type is Extra Action, but instead of creating a flurry, each of the actions occurs sequentially as noted in the Charm. Actions past the first use the indicated dice pool and require no additional effort on the part of the Terrestrial, leaving him free to do other things. Standard Combo rules govern the need to pay for other enhancing Charms per attack.</p>

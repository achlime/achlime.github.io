            <p>This charm is flagged because of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unclear errata: Errata adds Leader keyword without Essence rating, assuming Essence 1</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Dragon-Blood surrounds himself with a spinning vortex of material composed of his affinity element. Each mote of Essence spent adds 1L and 1B to the Dragon-Blood’s soak, and the character can spend up to a number of motes equal to his dots in Thrown. Soak provided by the Charm is armor. The armor also has special additional effects based on the Dragon-Blood’s aspect: <strong>Air</strong> armor consists of a swirling mass of ice crystals that buffet away ranged attacks, adding half the Dragon-Blood’s Essence to his soak against ranged attacks. <strong>Earth</strong> armor consists of a cloud of swirling dust and particulate matter that obscures an attacker’s view, applying half the Dragon-Blood’s Essence as an external penalty to ranged attacks against him. <strong>Fire</strong> armor consists of a cloud of red-hot embers that impair the vision of attackers at close range, applyinh half the Dragon-Blood’s Essence as an external penalty to melee attacks against him. <strong>Water</strong> armor surrounds the Dragon-Blood with a liquid cushion, adding half his Essence to his soak against melee attacks. <strong>Wood</strong> armor surrounds the Dragon-Blood with a cloud of choking pollen, allowing him to extend the effects of his anima-based plant toxins to anyone within a number of yards equal to his Essence.</p>
<p>The Dragon-Blooded can extend the benefits of this Charm to others, the Essence cost increases to two motes per point of soak, and one Willpower must be spent for each individual protected by the Charm. The Exalt cannot use this Charm to provide armor to another Dragon-Blood of a different aspect. Multiple activations of the Charm are cumulative, but cannot exceed the stated soak limits for a single activation of the Charm.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be an Air-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies. Each purchase of this Charm after the first adds an additional element to the Charm. Characters may evoke these by adding +2m per element to the Charm’s cost, in which case the armor has the powers conferred by those elements in addition to its normal effects.</p>

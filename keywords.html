            <p>This keyword denotes &lsquo;hero style&rsquo; Charms which grant an enhanced benefit when used by the Exalt type they belong to (for example, <a class="complex" href="martial-arts/solar-hero-style.html" title="canonical entry of topic bundle 'Solar Hero Style'"><span class="link-focus">Solar Hero style</span></a> Charms used by a Solar).</p>

            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Leader</h4>:</span>
            <p>Any character capable of acting in mass combat may use Charms as explained on p. 166 of Exalted, including unit commanders. However, applying non-Excellency Charms to enhance the entire unit&rsquo;s action or to extend the benefits of a personal Charm to the entire unit normally require justification as a form of special stunt. Charms with the Leader keyword do not require this justification and have the same overall function in mass combat when leading a complementary unit as they do normally, whether to enhance the unit or the unit&rsquo;s actions. Unit bonuses also apply normally to use of these Charms. Unless specific differences are noted, Leader Charms operate identically in both personal and mass combat. When the Leader keyword lists a number beside it, an Exalt must have that Essence rating to apply the Charm to a unit she leads. Cooperative Charms with a Leader function allow the led unit to join with its special characters to produce the usual magnified effect. By definition, Charms with the Leader keyword automatically have the <a class="complex" href="#war" title="canonical entry of keyword 'War'"><span class="link-focus">War</span></a> keyword.</p>

            <p>Powers like the Eclipse, Moonshadow and Fiend anima do not allow acquisition of Native Charms. Only natural wielders can learn Native charms. Exalted Charms and hero style expansions are natural to the appropriate type of Chosen. Spirit Charms are natural to gods, elementals, demons and akuma. Arcanoi are natural to ghosts. Raksha Charms are natural to Fair Folk. Primordial Charms are natural to Primordials, Green Sun Princes and Exalted akuma. The God-Blooded children of natural wielders cannot learn their parents&rsquo; Native Charms. Martial Arts Charms that are not Hero Style expansions cannot have the Native keyword.</p>

            <p>Charms with this Keyword create a temporary pool of Peripheral Essence, which can only be filled by terms outlined in the text of the Charm. Motes in these pools may only be used to activate offensive Charms with a duration of One action or less. Charms whose mote cost are paid for entirely from a character&rsquo;s Overdrive pool do not count as Charm activations, but must obey normal Combo rules if used in conjunction with other Charms. Other restrictions may be present in the text of the Charm. Motes gathered into the pools created by Overdrive Charms dissipate at the end of the scene, barring additional Charms to prolong their existence. Temporary mote pools created by the Overdrive keyword share their motes and stack together to determine the storage capacity of the overall pool. This Overdrive pool may store no more than 25 motes, regardless of the size of the pool generated by individual Charms with the Overdrive keyword.</p>

Characters cannot use counterattacks to responde to other counterattacks, and character cannor use multiple counterattacks to responde to a single attack unless otherwise stated. Making a counterattack imposes a cumulative counterattack penalty of -1 to your DV until your next action.</p>

            <p>This Charm&rsquo;s special damage is an Emotion effect.</p>
<p>When an Emotion effect instills a feeling but does not specify a particular result, treat the Emotion as a scene-duration one-die situational internal penalty that applies to all actions that do not fall in accordance with the emotion (such as attempting to decipher a First Age text while enraged), and a three-die penalty for all actions that run directly counter to the emotion (such as resisting a seduction attempt while feeling lust). Beyond these mechanics, players should endeavor to represent their character&rsquo;s emotional state in their choice of actions as befits the balance of the character&rsquo;s Virtues, especially Temperance.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Holy</h4>:</span>
            <p>This Charm&rsquo;s special damage is imbued with the judgement of the Unconquered Sun. Such Charms have extra impact when used against creatures of darkness (see p. 192). A complementary unit primarily composed of creatures of darkness is itself considered such for the purpose of Holy Charms.</p>
<p>Holy effects fail to function when invoked by creatures of darkness, whether they attempt to activate a Holy Charm or try to direct the Holy powers of an artifact. As a point of clarification, creatures of darkness can&rsquo;t use Holy Charms under any circumstances, and both types of Infernal Exalted are inherently creatures of darkness.</p>
<p>Infernal Exalted may learn Holy Charms solely to satisfy prerequisites but gain no other benefit from doing so. This limitation really only matters for once-righteous akuma, as no Infernal Charms have the Holy keyword. Charms that can be used in ways that do not have the Holy keyword may be learned and activated in those ways. Holy options remain unavailable.</p>
<p>Apart from inability to use Holy effects and increased vulnerability to such magic, creatures of darkness are no more &ldquo;evil&rdquo; as a result of the label itself. In practice, the beings judged enemies of Creation by the decree of the Unconquered Sun are named such because they really are wicked and dangerous. However, as some kindly ancestor spirits demonstrate, not all creatures of darkness mean harm to the world, even if cosmologically associated with a power inimical to divine law.</p>

<p>All special characters in a complementary unit and that unit&rsquo;s champion during mid-battle duels are fellow officers to one another. If a Charm functions differently when targeting a fellow officer, it deactivates if that relationship no longer applies due to either character leaving the unit. Cooperative Charms ignore their usual range limit for close contact when used by fellow officers, as the unit itself conducts the harmonization.</p>

Only after the character has gone a full day without spending Willpower to resist a Monstrous effect does the discount drop back to zero. Even if resistance costs no Willpower, the victim can only resist when the Charm permits Willpower to be spent resisting it.

<p>Victims in the grip of Rage cannot abort their rampage by spending Willpower to calm down, but their madness does make them invalid targets for all other Rage effects for as long as it lasts. Characters who pay Willpower to resist Rage also become immune to all Rage effects for one day.

            <p>As mockeries of Solar power, deathknights wield comparably potent Charms arranged in similar structures. Abyssal Mirror Charms list their Solar analogues in parentheses, which always have the same total number of prerequisite Charms and minimum trait requirements. For Eclipse and Moonshadow Castes, a mirror can substitute for its analogue with regard to any prerequisites as if it were the same Charm. This keyword also guides Charm reallocation for redeemed Abyssals or Solars corrupted to darkness.</p>
<p>Note that some Abyssal Charms mirror Solar Charms that are not in general use (i.e., not in the Exalted rulebook itself). In such cases, the Charm description appends a brief description of the Solar analogue. Storytellers can introduce these new Solar Charms to their series—or perhaps a Solar who wants to learn these Charms must seek an Abyssal teacher. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s option, cross-training Solars and Abyssals can deduce the Mirrors of each others&rsquo; Charms. For instance, a Dawn Caste could study with an Abyssal who knows <a class="complex" href="abyssal/lightning-clutch-of-the-raptor.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Lightning Clutch of the Raptor'"><span class="link-focus">Lightning Clutch of the Raptor</span></a> (see p. 133), and after four days he could learn its Mirror Charm, <a class="complex" href="abyssal/lightning-clutch-of-the-raptor.html" title="mirror entry of charm 'Lightning Clutch of the Raptor'"><span class="link-focus">Deft Hands Deflection</span></a>. Solars and Abyssals thus become valuable but morally objectionable sources of Charms for the other side to learn.</p>

            <p>This keyword allows Abyssals to make a Charm&rsquo;s effect permanent, enabling her to use it without further expended or committed costs. This is not done lightly, however, as the transformation is irreversible and such Charms always carry some kind of drawback. Therefore, for every persistent advantage gained with this keyword, an Abyssal also bears a new curse to compound the doom of his Dark Fate.</p>
<p>Turning a Charm into a permanent Taint also costs bonus points or experience points. The sample costs are based on comparison with Wyld mutations (see The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II—The Wyld, p. 144). The more extreme (or useful) the effect of making a Charm permanent is the more points doing so costs.</p>

            <p>If a Charm has this keyword, then multiple Dragon-Blooded who all know the Charm can use it simultaneously while in close contact. Close contact means that each participating Dragon-Blood must be within five yards of one or more other participants to harmonize animas. By doing so, the animas of all participants interact, improving the potency of the Charm. Often, <a class="complex" href="#elemental" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Elemental'"><span class="link-focus">Elemental</span></a> Charms (per the next new keyword) are also Cooperative Charms, and Dragon-Blooded using them in tandem can generate more sophisticated elemental effects over much larger areas than a single Dragon-Blood could while working alone. Only Dragon-Blooded can use such Charms cooperatively. Eclipse or Moonshadow Caste Exalted can learn these Charms, but the anima of a Celestial Exalt is not designed to interact with that of other Exalted so as to produce the same effect. Generally, Charms with this keyword can be used in Combos unless otherwise noted. A Cooperative Charm can never be used in a Combo if it is also being used in a cooperative manner, though, i.e. with two or more Dragon-Blooded using it simultaneously to gain the cooperative benefits.</p>

            <p>A Charm with this keyword has special effects on human descendants and occasionally other blood relatives.

            <p>A Charm with this keyword has an elemental effect. In some cases, this effect is purely cosmetic, and the underlying Charm functions the same way regardless of the aspect of the Dragon-Blood who uses it. More often, however, the Charm functions somewhat differently depending on the Exalt&rsquo;s aspect. For example, <a class="complex" href="dragon-blooded/elemental-bolt-attack.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Elemental Bolt Attack'"><span class="link-focus">Elemental Bolt Attack</span></a> (see pp. 133-134) produces the same base damage effect regardless of who uses it, but if a Fire Aspect uses it, it inflicts additional burning damage, whereas the version fired by a Wood Aspect poisons the target with a plant toxin. The Charm descriptions explain how such Charms change by aspect. An Eclipse or Moonshadow Caste Exalt who learns an Elemental Charm understands only the version used by the Dragon-Blood from whom she learned the Charm.</p>
<p>When the same or different Charms list effects that vary by element which are functionally identical, these effects never stack. For example, a target choking on seawater cannot have his action delayed more than three ticks by repeatedly hitting him with further action-delaying attacks.</p>
<div class="admonition errata">
<p class="admonition-title">Errata notes</p>
<p>Some common Elemental effects function differently than printed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The -2 internal penalty for buffeting should be a -1 external penalty.</li>
<li>Charms that induce knockback or knockdown with a successful hit always function and do not afford a roll for the   * victim to avoid falling prone.</li>
<li>Further, hurling someone back or prone is a Knockback effect and only imposes the buffeting penalty on   * complementary unit targets unless the Charm encompasses most of the area the unit occupies.</li>
<li>References to bonus levels of damage (usually via fire) add dice instead.</li>
<li>Wood toxins are a Poison effect and any penalties they impose are internal. Although they do not stack, these toxins automatically take hold with a successful hit to impose their usual penalty; the victim receives no roll to avoid this. For reference, the Wood anima toxin is: Damage (Essence)L/action, Toxicity (Essence), Tolerance None, Penalty –(half Essence) and inflicts one dose per action to each victim who makes skin-to-skin contact, whether momentary or continuous.</li>

            <p>A Charm with this keyword has a greater effect if the Exalt voluntarily forfeits his life when activating it. The mystical suicide joins the Terrestrial’s soul and Essence directly to the Elemental Dragon associated with his aspect, subsuming the totality of his name and being into the Dragon like a drop of water returned to the ocean. Only the empty shell of the Terrestrial’s body remains, unless it is consumed by the Charm’s effect. When using the Martyr keyword, death substitutes for the usual cost of the Charm, and it may be expressly activated as a reflexive action regardless of its normal type, allowing Terrestrial elders to fight to the last mote and still unleash one final act of greatness. Characters may activate one Martyr effect with their death, plus one different additional one for every dot of Essence above 6. (An Essence 10 paragon—if such a being existed—could die the death of five dragons.)</p>

            <p>Each Sidereal Charm tree culminates in a powerful Charm that has a special connection to the scripture of that constellation and Ability. To perform that Charm, a Sidereal must write that scripture on a prayer strip and infuse it with Essence. Without the right prayer strip, the Charm cannot be used.</p>
<p>When a character activates a Charm with this keyword, the prayer strip he uses becomes noticeable to magic-detecting powers such as <a class="complex" href="solar/all-encompassing-sorcerers-sight.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight'"><span class="link-focus">All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 222) or <a class="complex" href="sidereal/telltale-symphony.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Telltale Symphony'"><span class="link-focus">Telltale Symphony</span></a> (see p. 169). What once was normal paper and ink becomes immune to bashing damage and gains a lethal soak of 10, as well as 25 health levels, for as long as the Charm&rsquo;s duration lasts. The strip can reflexively block or dodge all attacks—even ones that are normally unblockable—with a value equal to the character&rsquo;s own unmodified Defense Value. (A prayer strip can either parry or dodge, based on whether it is immobile or free-floating.) If attacks can get past this Defense Value, overcome a strip&rsquo;s soak and eventually inflict enough damage to destroy the strip, the Charm that requires the strip&rsquo;s use ends immediately.</p>

Simply using such a Charm reinforces the Virtue&rsquo;s value in Creation. Therefore, any roll related to the Charm&rsquo;s use—be it a granted extra action, an action the Charm supplements or any other roll mentioned in the Charm&rsquo;s description—can benefit in this way from bonus dice gained by channeling the specific Virtue named in the keyword. Channeling Willpower through the Virtue for a Charm does count against the maximum number of times per story a character may channel Willpower through that Virtue.

            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Blasphemy</h4>:</span>
            <p>Charms with this keyword snarl the Tapestry when activated in Creation or Yu-Shan, triggering alerts in the Loom of Fate and the Realm Defense Grid&rsquo;s central control room that each display the Charm&rsquo;s basic effect, the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence rating and the location where the Charm was activated. How the forces of Heaven respond generally depends on available resources and the relative threat posed by the incursion, but any use of these Charms invites some possibility of intervention by Sidereal demon hunters or their often-unwitting pawns in Creation. As a very rough benchmark, Storytellers can roll one die and dispatch a Celestial intervention if the result is less than or equal to the Charm&rsquo;s minimum Essence. Teams responding to blasphemy Charms with a minimum of Essence 7+ will almost certainly include Aerial Legion reinforcements or comparably deadly forces. Unless the Infernal uses a Charm that seems to threaten Creation as a whole, she can at least count on finishing the current scene before any response team arrives.</p>
<p>More locally, players of all gods and Celestial Exalted within a mile of a blasphemy Charm activation make a reflexive (Perception + Occult) roll at difficulty (10 – the Infernal&rsquo;s Essence rating) for the characters to mystically sense the waves of Infernal Essence radiating from the Exalt for the duration of the Charm. This numinous awareness typically manifests as pain, nausea or vertigo but inflicts no actual penalties. However, characters who can feel the presence automatically succeed on all attempts to track the Infernal, pierce her Stealth with Awareness or otherwise know the tainted Exalt&rsquo;s exact location relative to their own position. Charms cannot conceal or disguise an Infernal from individuals who sense her presence unless they explicitly state they are capable of doing so. Observers whose players fail the roll to sense a Blasphemy Charm can make additional attempts with miscellaneous actions, but the difficulty increases normally for retrying. Blasphemy effects that are also Sorcerous (see below) do not necessarily betray the Infernal&rsquo;s location. Instead, the Blasphemy radiates from the target(s) and the center of any affected area.</p>

            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Desecration</h4>:</span>
            <p>Infernal Shaping Charms with this keyword inflict mutations on targeted beings. These effects are modeled with Wyld mutations, examples of which can be found on pages 288-291 of <strong>Exalted</strong>, pages 207-209 of <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Lunars</strong> and pages 144-148 of <strong>The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II—The Wyld</strong>. Mutations imposed through Desecration Charms are considered internal mutations and do not inhibit a creature&rsquo;s viability in Creation or Essence potential unless they state otherwise. Any positive mutations permanently imposed on a character are considered a Training effect costing (mutation points x 2) experience points. Permanent negative mutations inflicted with Desecration Charms may offset this cost by their (mutation point cost x 2) experience points, but these cannot reduce the experience required below 0. The experience cost discount can be banked and applied toward the cost of future positive mutations. No combination of effects that includes Desecration Charms can bestow more dots of temporary positive mutations than the target&rsquo;s (Willpower + Essence). The mutation points associated with each category are: 1 (pox), 2 (affliction), 4 (blight), 6 (abomination), -1 (deficiency), -2 (debility) and -4 (deformity).</p>
<p>If the target of a Desecration Charm is not already a creature of darkness, the only mutation that can be bestowed is that deformity (which helps offset the experience cost of positive mutations as normal). The mutant becomes a native of Malfeas vulnerable to and unable to use Holy effects. Targets marked by this mutation or who are creatures of darkness already may be further mutated in any way permitted by the Desecration Charm in question. Note that Infernals can&rsquo;t impose mutations that a being isn&rsquo;t capable of having. For instance, Essence Channeler can&rsquo;t be given to a being that already wields Essence. The Storyteller may also decide a particular mutation is inappropriate for a given target even if no rules prohibit the combination. All mutations should be thematically appropriate to their Infernal source. Even a gift of beauty is ultimately alien and probably at least mildly disturbing; Erembour is nearly as beautiful as Venus but not quite so desired.</p>

            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Sorcerous</h4>:</span>
            <p>Charms with this keyword channel Essence according to the patterns the Primordials negotiated amongst themselves when they seared the principles of sorcery into the Wyld&rsquo;s shinmaic substrata. As such, these Charms may be countered or dispelled by appropriate effects as if they were spells with a circle based on their minimum Essence: 1-3 (emerald), 4-5 (sapphire) and 6+ (adamant). Necromancers may also dispel Sorcerous Charms without their countermagic losing a circle of relative potency, provided they do not have an Essence rating lower than the Infernal&rsquo;s rating at the time the Sorcerous Charm was activated. On the plus side, these effects require no commitment of Essence to sustain, even those with Duration greater than instant. However, their creator can&rsquo;t deactivate such effects at will unless stated otherwise. Countering a Sorcerous Charm does not release any sort of Essence backlash unless noted. During the Primordial War, Solar and Lunar Exalted developed specialized Charms to dispel sorcerous effects; these anti-Primordial techniques fell out of favor with the advent of sorcery among the Exalted, since countermagic spells were both easier to learn and more efficient.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Velocity</h4>:</span>
            <p>Some Adorjani Charms with durations longer than Instant have this keyword, requiring that the Infernal maintain a minimum speed. If the character spends longer than one tick moving slower than this limit, the Charm automatically deactivates (but may be reactivated). Note that this means actual movement. Running in tight circles does not count; the beginning and end of the character&rsquo;s movement path each tick must be spaced no closer than the distance the Infernal Exalt may cover with a Move action. Riding on a mount or vehicle also doesn&rsquo;t count—the character&rsquo;s speed must come from his own power and means of locomotion. The most common Velocity requirement is that the character must continuously dash at maximum possible speed.</p>

            <p>Much like the Holy Charms of Creation, this keyword indicates that a Charm is imbued with the divine order of the Great Maker. Such Charms have extra impact against creatures of the Void and cannot be used by such beings. Charms with optional or secondary Axiomatic effects may be used without these effects, however.</p>

            <p>As long as a Charm with this keyword is installed, the Alchemical gains the listed number of points of permanent Clarity. Champions afflicted with Gremlin Syndrome gain permanent Dissonance points instead. Other beings who somehow acquire these Charms gain a Clarity (or Dissonance) track like an Alchemical, adding the appropriate permanent points to it.</p>

            <p>Municipal is the name applied to Essence 8+ Alchemical Charms. These wonders of industry go far beyond
mere bodily implants, generally taking the form of large-scale elements of Autochthonian civic infrastructure. A
Municipal Charm could include an entire factory (or a factory could simply be a small component or submodule
of an Essence 10 Municipal Charm).</p>

            <span class="runin-header"><h4>Void</h4>:</span>
            <p>Installation of any Void-keyword Charm gives the user a temporary form of the Gremlin Syndrome mutation (see pp. 112-113) that lasts as long as any Voidtech remains installed in the Exalt&rsquo;s Charm Slots. Should the Alchemical reach Dissonance 10 for any reason, the infection metastasizes and spreads to his Essence reservoir, making the mutation permanent and rendering him a creature of the Void.</p>
<p>Because Voidtech is invasive and disrupts Essence profiles that are not fully aligned with the Void, it cannot be removed with Vat Surrogate Reweaving Technique (see p. 194).</p>

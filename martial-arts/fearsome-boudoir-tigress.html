            <p>Just as every object can be a vehicle for the deliverance of pleasure in the
hands of the Courtesean, so to can it be a bringer of death. This charm allows
the Martial Artist to spend 1m to reflexively ready an improvised weapon which
meets the critera established in the Form Weapon&rsquo;s section above.  If doing so
would be favorable, and given the nature of improvised weapons it almost always
is, the Martial Artist treats the weapon as if it had Speed 5, Accuracy +0,
Defense +0 instead of its normal value for those traits.  If the martial artist
has the Red Handed Courtesan Form active, she may spend 2m when readying this
weapon and instead apply the trait bonuses of an Exceptional quality weapon to
it.  This persists for as long as motes remain commited to the charm.  Weapons
improvised with this charm are more hardy than they ought to be, but will still
break fairly easily.  If the character uses his weapon to parry an attack from
an attacker with a Strength greater than her (Essence x 2) or which has a base
damage greater than her (essence x 3) it becomes useless at the end of the tick
and must be discarded and replaced.</p>

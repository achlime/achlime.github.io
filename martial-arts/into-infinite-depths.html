            <p><em>…who desired the ideal lover.</em></p>
<p>Clearing her mind of all but the sensation of the moment, the martial artist cuts her gaze across an opponent. In so doing she sees him anew, with unsurpassed clarity. The character immediately gains the following knowledge about one individual: what manner of being the target is (Solar Exalt, god, raksha, etc), which martial arts styles he knows at least one Charm from, which martial arts styles he knows up to the Form-type Charm, which martial arts styles he has mastered, whether he has any Intimacies toward the martial artist, and the nature of those Intimacies, if they exist.</p>
<p>For the rest of the scene, the martial artist gains a +2 bonus to her DVs and MDVs against any opponent she has evaluated in this manner. This Charm costs only four motes to activate while <a class="complex" href="sapphire-veil-of-passion-form.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Sapphire Veil of Passion Form'"><span class="link-focus">Sapphire Veil of Passion Form</span></a> is active.</p>

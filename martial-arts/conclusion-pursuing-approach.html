        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>At the pinnacle of the Violet Bier of Sorrows, the martial artist learns to draw strength from the pain of others. As her enemies falter before her before her blows, her resolve only increases. This Charm upgrades Violet Bier of Sorrows Form. As the character invokes it, she may pay a surcharge of ten motes and a point of Willpower to add the following effects to the form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The martial artist’s unarmed attacks deal aggravated damage to creatures outside of fate and consume their motes as though they were spirits.</li>
<li>Wound penalties are tripled by the unnatural mental influence of Violet Bier of Sorrows Form instead of just double. The cost to resist rises to five Willpower.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Sidereal may affix a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Expectant Maiden to her weapon with her own blood as she invokes this Charm, causing the blade to glow with a radiant burgundy light. Doing so grants additional benefits as a Prayer Strip effect: Whenever the Sidereal damages a character with an unarmed attack, they lose a point of Willpower. Characters without remaining Willpower instead lose ten motes, and can be shaped dead as per Life-Severing Blow if they have no motes remaining.</p>

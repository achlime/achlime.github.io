            <p>Sighting a violet glimmer of the Essence of Endings in her enemy’s soul, the Sidereal strikes through it to bring them closer to their death. Add (Essence) to the raw damage of an unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm. The same amount is also added to the minimum damage of the attack, granting it the Overwhelming tag.</p>
<p>A character reduced to their Incapacitated level by an attack supplemented with Life-Severing Blow can be unmade as a Shaping effect, killing them instantly and reducing their corpse to ash. Against mortals, even a single level of damage is sufficient to shape them dead.</p>

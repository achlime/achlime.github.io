        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In the hands of a martial artist using this Charm, a delicate paper fan can be
infused with Essence that makes it cut like a razor. The character treats all
paper fans (or other similar props such as brushes or mirrors) as wind-fire
wheels.  She treats all sashes, long hems, sleeves and so on as seven-section
staves. The damage these weapons inflict is lethal, though their appearance
does not change.  </p>
<p>In addition, if the character uses an actual war fan or other accouterment that
has been properly constructed for use in the martial arts, the character may
enhance the weapon&rsquo;s Accuracy, Damage or Defense by an amount equal to her
Essence.  (Pick any one value upon activating the Charm.) Sashes, cloak-hems
and other clothing turned into weighted ropes and then enhanced by this Charm
deal less damage than they would if empowered by the Charm alone &ndash; but the
character can wield them with much greater Speed, Accuracy or Defense.</p>

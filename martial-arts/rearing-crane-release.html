        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm supplements the act of releasing an opponent from a clinch. The martial artist pivots out of the clinch, throwing his opponent over his shoulder on a high-angle trajectory. The target is hurled to any point in midair up to twice the usual throw distance, where she hangs suspended in defiance of gravity. She cannot move from that spot until the Charm ends unless she possesses a form of self-propelled aerial locomotion. She falls normally at the end of the duration unless another effect keeps her in the air.</p>

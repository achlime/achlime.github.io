        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The art of lovemaking goes hand in hand with the art of murder for the
Red-Handed Courtesans.  They practice both with the same prowess and ecstatic
abandon.  Thus, none who lie with a Courtesan can truly know whether her she
will bring them bliss or death.  Indeed, she often will do both.  This charm
supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack against a character the Martial
Artist is currently interacting with socially.  It explicitly allows this
attack to resolve as if it were a surprise attack without requiring the martial
artist to take any Stealth actions, the magic of the charm compensates.</p>
<p>The Martial Artist&rsquo;s (Manipulation + Martial Arts) against the target&rsquo;s MDV.
The target&rsquo;s MDV is modified by the relative Appearance modifier as if this was
a social attack.  If the target is engaged in coitus with the martial artist,
they are considered distracted imposing another -1 external penalty on their
MDV. If this roll succeeds, the Martial Artist hides her killing intent beneath
a veil of unbridled eroticism, rendering the attack unexpected.</p>
<p>This charm is a unnatural mental influence Illusion effect, and the target may
spend 2wp to negate the attack&rsquo;s unexpected aspect. Targets subject to this
attack seldom let their guard down around the Martial Artist, becoming immune
to it, regardless of its success or failure, for their (Temperance) Weeks
thereafter.</p>

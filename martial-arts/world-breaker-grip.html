        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal Monster holds its prey like a beast&rsquo;s chew toy, dragging it around effortlessly. This Charm enhances a grapple attack against an opponent light enough to drag around (see sidebar), substituting Martial Arts for Athletics for the feat of strength. The Exalt grapples using a single limb of his choice without any off-hand penalties. If the attack succeeds, he can only hold the opponent and may not break hold or crush with that attack. However, the grapple no longer requires any effort apart from tying up the non-reflexive use of the attacking limb. Consequently, the attacker may defend and fight as if carrying any other large weapon without the usual restrictions placed on grapplers, but he may not make further physical attacks against the foe in hand. He must still roll to maintain control each action, but this roll is reflexive for him, so he always applies his full dice pool regardless of whatever other actions he takes. The Charm immediately ends if the held opponent escapes or if the martial artist uses control of the grapple to do anything besides hold the enemy to continue the effect.</p>
<p>The martial artist can use a held enemy as an improvised one-handed weapon to strike or parry (the restriction on parrying while grappling is lifted for this purpose) using the following statistics: Speed 6; Accuracy -3; Damage (Strength x 2)B; Defense -3; Rate 2; Tags: P, R. Whenever a wielded character hits a target or blocks an attack, she suffers (the martial artist&rsquo;s Strength) dice of piercing damage from the impact. This damage is bashing unless the held character is used to block a lethal or aggravated attack. If this punishment kills a held victim, her corpse remains a useful weapon for the rest of the Charm&rsquo;s duration.</p>

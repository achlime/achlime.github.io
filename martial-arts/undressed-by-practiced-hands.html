            <p>The practiced courtesan knows how to free her clients from the confines of
their vestments, and can apply this trick to her enemy&rsquo;s armor.  This charm
supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack.  The attack suffers a called shot
penalty appropiate to the type of armor being targeted; -1 for light armor or
clothes, -2 for medium, -3 for heavy and -4 for superheavy armor.  The attack
does no damage to the target and does not contend with soak, instead the
martial artist rolls (Dexterity + Extra Successes) and reduces her target&rsquo;s
Armored soak (both Lethal and Bashing) by 1 point per success.  This soak
reduction applies against any attack if the armor is mundane, but only against
the Martial Artist&rsquo;s attacks if it is attuned Artifact armor. Armor reduced to
zero soak is removed, if it is mundane or unattuned.  This charm has no effect
on soak provided by charms or sorcery and not resulting from actual physical
armament.  When used against a target with an intimacy of lust towards the
Martial Artist, invocations of this charm which follow a successful application
of this charm cost 2m. The Armor remains penalized until the character
re-applies it, requiring the normal procedure for donning armor but taking only
60 seconds.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The practiced courtesan has studied well the arts and sciences of pleasing her
clients. Her control over the muscles of her lower body is enviable, almost
supernatural. This discipline, the Red-Handed Courtesans learned, could easily
be applied to combat. The Martial Artist entwines her opponent with her legs,
while some may find this position enviable, those who have felt the powerful
crushing force the Martial Artist is capable of exerting when her attitude
shifts from tenderness to toughness regard the prospect of being so embraced
with equal parts fear and desire. Essence grants the Courtesan&rsquo;s legs greater
strength, allowing her to inflict lethal damage with a crushing attack, and
adding +2 to the attack&rsquo;s base damage. The Martial Artist, accustomed to
maintaining this grip on bodies in motion, also adds one success to attempts
to retain control of or establish this clinch. It is said, though never
publicly, that this Charm can be employed, with potentially devastating
results, during coitus, though the muscles enhanced in this instance are not
the legs. If it supplements a Clinch attack made mid coitus, generally by
virtue of a surprise attack, this charm adds +4 to the Clinch attack&rsquo;s base
damage instead of +2.</p>

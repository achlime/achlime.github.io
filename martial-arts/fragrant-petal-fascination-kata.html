        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As the Exalt performs the sultry, languid moves of this Charm, ethereal music
whispers in the air, and flower petals flow from her sleeves and the folds of
her robes to swirl around her. The martial artist&rsquo;s player rolls (Charisma +
Martial Arts), and the players of all those within a number of yards equal to
the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence must compare the result to their characters&rsquo; Dodge MDV.
Those whose MDVs do not negate the successes on the martial artist&rsquo;s player&rsquo;s
roll find their characters transfixed in place, enraptured by the beauty of the
kata and perfume of the petals. Even those in range of this Charm who are not
entranced experience a hallucinogenic vertigo, suffering an internal penalty
equal to the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence to all dice pools.</p>
<p>Targets who are entranced believe whatever the Exalt tells them. The Exalt can
issue commands to those enraptured and expect them to be followed, regardless
of the victim&rsquo;s Intimacies or Motivation. (The victim safely ignores suicidal
orders.) This Charm does not affect characters with a higher permanent Essence
than the martial artist, though. If the Exalt halts her kata for any reason, or
if the scene ends, the fascination slowly wears off. In ongoing combat, the
effects linger for a number of actions equal to the martial artist&rsquo;s Essence.
During this waning period, the victims suffer an internal penalty equal to the
Exalt&rsquo;s Essence to all dice pools.  Enraptured victims retain vague memories of
what they did under the effects of this Charm and suffer a strange melancholy
afterward, imposing a -1 internal penalty to Conviction rolls for a number of
days equal to the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence.</p>

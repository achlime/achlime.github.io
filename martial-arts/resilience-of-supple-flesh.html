            <p>Only the most talented of professional lovers are ever taught this style. By
the time they learn this martial art, most have satisfied some the appetites of
some truly strange and depraved individuals (or in some cases several such
individuals at once.) Their skin is still soft supple and firm, it is their
business to be beautiful and desirable, but the finely trained muscles beneath
give their flesh strength that belies its apparent softness. Blows that should
raise welts do not, injuries that should cause bruises merely redden the skin,
and cuts are never as deep or as serious as they seem like they should be.  </p>
<p>Spending motes to activate this Charm, the character&rsquo;s Essence augments his
soak, reinforcing this impossible toughness. While this charm is active, the
Martial Artist adds +(Essence)B/+(Essence/2)L to her natural soak and may Parry
Lethal attack&rsquo;s unarmed.  If they are mortal, they also become immune to
natural Disfigurement as a result of suffering damage (though they may still
suffer from other naturally inflicted Disabling wounds). At Essence 3+ the
Courtesan also does not bleed when damage is inflicted upon her. Her Essence
maintaining the perfection of her physical body.</p>

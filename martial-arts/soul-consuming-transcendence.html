        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Few deathknights have even learned that Hungry Ghost Style has this secret final technique, which could set its masters to devouring their fellow Abyssals. By spending one minute monstrously gorging on the corpse of an Essence-wielder who died within the past hour, a master of Hungry Ghost Style can digest some of the deceased&rsquo;s mystical prowess along with her flesh and blood. He instantly intuits the basic description of every Charm the dead character knew as if they were all Obvious and may choose one of them to steal for which he meets all trait minimums (though this Charm cannot steal permanent Charms or Sidereal Martial Arts).</p>
<p>If the master knows all prerequisites and is otherwise capable of learning the stolen Charm, he may pay the normal experience point cost to do so without training time or tutelage. If the Charm has permutations or variations, the martial artist learns it exactly as its original owner knew it, apart from using his own traits. If he does not wish to pay this experience or cannot learn the Charm for whatever reason, the stolen knowledge lasts only a number of days equal to its owner&rsquo;s Essence rating at the time of death. During this period, the martial artist may activate the stolen Charm as if he had learned it.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of Charms an Abyssal can steal at one time, except that he can get only one Charm per fresh corpse and temporary thefts quickly fade once a killing spree ends. Once a body serves as a target for this Charm, too little of its residual Essence remains to provide further knowledge.</p>

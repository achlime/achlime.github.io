        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This is the most feared technique of the Red Handed Courtesan Style. Many are
the stories of courtesans who used this technique on their unwitting companions
while in the throes of passion, and keeping them there until they expired.
This Charm supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack. The attack, should it
land, does lethal damage. The Courtesan&rsquo;s hand is reinforced by Essence, taking
on the properties of a blade.  Should the attack do more than one level of
lethal damage, the courtesan may opt to reduce the damage to one level and
instead make the wound bleed profusely. Delaying her gratification, the
Courtesan twists and flexes her fingers inside the wound, causing it to bleed
and become more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Mortals attempting to close the wound find the difficulty of the (Wits +
Medicine) rises by the martial artist&rsquo;s Essence.  Furthermore the wound bleeds
more rapidly, they loose one level of lethal damage every (Stamina) ticks, as
the blood hemorrhages rapidly from their body.  Exalts and Essence-users fare
somewhat better, the difficulty of the roll to reflexively close the wound does
not rise.  However, they do bleed out at an increased rate, suffering one
lethal level every (Stamina) actions. The treatment of any being with Medicine
2 or higher automatically closes these wounds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the attack was an unexpected attack the Martial Artist rolls
(Manipulation + Martial Arts) against  the target&rsquo;s MDV. The target&rsquo;s MDV is
modified by the relative Appearance modifier as if this was a social attack. If
this roll succeeds, the target is unaware that he is wounded so, and instead
climaxes violently each time he loses a health level. This imposes a -2 fatigue
penalty while the wound is open.  This is an Illusion effect that can be
resisted with 2wp or 1wp if the character is not attracted to the Martial
Artist&rsquo;s Gender or Species. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence.</p>

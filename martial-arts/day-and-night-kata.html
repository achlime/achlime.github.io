        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The martial artist makes it certain that she will endure to strike back at an opponent, as surely as day follows the tribulations of the night. Invoked in response to an attack that successfully strikes the character, this Charm does nothing to immediately protect her from the blow, but it does present a formidable defense that keeps further attacks from having any chance of harming her. Invoking this Charm against an attacker renders it impossible for that attacker to direct any subsequent attacks at the martial artist until his (the attacker&rsquo;s) DV refreshes. This is treated as a counterattack, even though the defense is not inherently hostile.</p>

<p><em>the maiden was satisfied.</em></p>
<p>The martial artist executes a languid kata, hesitates a moment, and then erupts into a shuddering battle pattern. Her anima unfolds into a towering, shifting array of cerulean and sapphire ribbons, which twine about her body even as they strain for the sky. She levitates a finger&rsquo;s length above the ground as she moves, incidentally gaining perfect balance and the ability to move safely over hazardous terrain. Players of all characters who possess any sort of Intimacy toward her, positive or negative, must fail a Compassion roll or pay one Willpower per attack made against her. If she manages to strike any character who possesses no Essence or Willpower (non-Essence users are not evaluated for current Essence, only Willpower) with an unarmed attack, that character is immediately rendered unconscious for (attacker&rsquo;s Martial Arts) hours as a Crippling effect.</p>
<p>Sapphire Veil of Passion Form grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. While it is active, the martial artist gains a single offensive mote on any tick in which he causes an enemy to gain a positive Intimacy towards himself, is attacked by a character with a positive Intimacy towards him, inflicts a Crippling effect on an enemy with an unarmed attack, or chooses to hold a clinched enemy. No more than one mote may be gained per tick in this way, even if multiple triggers occur.</p>

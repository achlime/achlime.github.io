            <p>The Martial Artist can blur the line between exstacy and agony, such that to
outsiders it is impossible to tell which the Martial Artist is inflicting.</p>
<p>The Martial Artist rolls (Manipulation + Martial Arts) against the MDV of any
who witness her.  The target&rsquo;s MDV is modified by the relative Appearance
modifier as if this was a social attack. If succesful, the target cannot tell
that the Martial Artist and whomever she is fighting are engaged in a bout
rather than a form of sexual gratification.  The blows of her enemies are
merely the actions of a passionate lover in the eyes of onlookers, and screams
and wails merely the sounds of passion to thier ears.</p>
<p>Characters who cannot directly see the Martial Artist or her partner(s) must
pay 2wp too look through this illusion, while characters who can have an easier
time seeing the truth, and may pay 1wp.  Any mortal affected by this charm
counts a scene spent under its effects as a scene spent building an intimacy of
lust towards the Martial Artist. This is an Emotion effect which cannot be
resisted without resisting the Illusion effect, which dismisses it
automatically.  The mental influence imposed by this charm is unnatural mental
influence.  Characters engaged in combat with the martial artist or are
unnafected.</p>

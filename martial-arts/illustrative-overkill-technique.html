        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Just killing an enemy is boring. Killing an enemy so brutally that every witness finds her heart and limbs numbed with terror… now that&rsquo;s satisfying. An Abyssal may invoke this Charm reflexively in Step Ten of attack resolution by spending three motes and one Willpower whenever he kills or mortally wounds an opponent with an unarmed attack. As a base effect, the Charm enables the deathknight to kill his victim in whatever horrific manner the player finds appropriate, whether tearing the foe in half, punching into her abdomen and pulling out handfuls of viscera or worse.</p>
<p>Every enemy or neutral character who can witness this execution and has a Dodge MDV less than the Abyssal&rsquo;s (Martial arts + Essence) must pay one Willpower or be overwhelmed with horror as an unnatural Emotion effect. While afflicted with this fear and revulsion, characters suffer an internal penalty equal to the Abyssal&rsquo;s Essence rating to all non-reflexive actions for the rest of the scene. They cannot, however, be made to spend more Willpower or suffer further penalties through repeated use of Illustrative Overkill Technique. If it needs to be said, use of this Charm invariably prompts Morale checks in mortals, who tend to run screaming or fall to their knees retching.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal raises one or both arms and brings her fist(s) down like a hammer, driving a target into the ground. This Charm enhances an unarmed attack, causing the target to suffer automatic knockdown with no roll to resist if the attack hits. Additionally, every other character apart from the Charm user within (Martial Arts) yards of the impact must check for knockdown at a difficulty of (the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence).</p>
<p>The surface beneath the target also suffers the raw damage of the attack, though this damage is always bashing and automatically piercing. Normally, Storytellers can dispense with calculating damage to the ground and simply assume this Charm leaves the target in a small crater. However, targets standing on flimsy structures may find their footing blasted out from under them, especially from high-damage attacks.</p>
<p>If an Exalt uses this Charm to successfully strike a materialized god or demon with equal or lesser Essence, she may pay an additional Willpower. This strews the victim&rsquo;s body as splatters of ephemera and gobbets of divine flesh in the usual crater. Although it appears to witnesses that the spirit died—messily—it is no more harmed than normal from the attack, save for being forcibly returned to its natural dematerialized state in addition to being knocked prone.</p>

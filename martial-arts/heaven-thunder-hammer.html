        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The fury of the Lawgivers scatters their enemies like leaves before the storm. This Charm supplements an unarmed martial Arts attack. it ensures that the Solar&rsquo;s attack throws his enemy backward one yard for each point of pre-soak damage. Targets that trike hard objects take one die of damage for each yard they would otherwise have traveled. This damage is typically bashing but it can be lethal if the target strikes a sufficiently dangerous object.</p>
<p><em>Enchancement:</em> The target is thrown three yards for each point of pre-soak damage. At Essence 4+ the Solar may add one mote to Heave Thunder hammer&rsquo;s activation cost in order to send the victim flashing and additional (Essence × 5) yards toward and object he can perceive. This movement occurs before the normal movement caused by Heaven Thunder Hammer begins. This additional knockback distance does not add to the damage the victim takes for yards they would have otherwise traveled, but helps to ensure that the victim strikes a solid object at the absolute beginning of his flight, even if that object is far from the point of attack. This effect expressly allows a Lawgiver to bash a rooted target into scenery within (Essence × 5) yards without actually moving the target. The target does not appear to move; rather nearby walls and trees develop giant craters as if the victim were being driven into them, while the Solar&rsquo;s blows are seen to unleash devastating shockwaves that annihilate the scenery. Treat all such blows as incurring the full damage of a Heaven Thunder Hammer collision at point-blank range. Using this effect turns Heaven Thunder Hammer Obvious. Finally, the cost drops to two motes.</p>

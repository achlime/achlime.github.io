        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The martial artist&rsquo;s movements take on the sinuous sexualized quality that is
identified with this style. She is unabashed, and unafraid, jaded by her
experiences in the world. She could be facing a demonic horde or a single
adversary and she looks upon them with the same sultry defiance. Her movements
have an exaggerated quality designed to excite, entice or otherwise distract
her opponent. For the duration of the combat she allows her sexuality to
empower her fighting. She is a being of touch and physicality.</p>
<p>While this Charm is active, anyone targeted by the Martial Artist&rsquo;s actions
suffers a -1 external penalty on DV and MDV for each of the following
conditions that is met (these penalties are cumulative):</p>
<ul>
<li>The target bears an intimacy of lust towards the Martial Artist</li>
<li>The target was engaged in sex with the Martial Artist in the previous hour</li>
<li>The target&rsquo;s Temperance is exceeded by the Martial Arists&rsquo;s Appearance</li>
</ul>
<p>Treat these penalties as a product of an Emotion effect which can be resisted
for one action by spending 1wp. This is a form of Unnatural Mental influence.
Penalties on DV are only effective for unarmed attacks by the Martial Artist.</p>
<p>Finally, the Martial Artist is so accustomed to bedroom environments she adds
an additional +1 to the DV bonus provided by hard cover derived from taking
shelter behind furniture, bed-posts, or other household items.</p>
<p>This Form-type charm is not characterized by any aggressively hostile movements
and appears as a form of flirtation rather than combat readiness to onlookers.</p>

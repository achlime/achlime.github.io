            <p>The Exalt&rsquo;s flowing sashes, hems, sleeves or what have you act with an uncanny
dexterity to grapple opponents and their weapons. After successfully dodging or
otherwise negating an enemy&rsquo;s attack, the Exalt&rsquo;s player may make a reflexive
(Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll to have his character&rsquo;s cloak or flowing
sleeves snare her opponent&rsquo;s attacking weapon or appendage.</p>
<p>In order to make a successful retaliatory grapple, the martial artist must
score as many successes as his opponent did on her attack. The defender may
evade this attack only with Charms or as part of a flurry on her same action.
(An opponent is unlikely to call for such a flurry unless she has already seen
the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan use this Charm in a previous action, however.) If
the martial artist&rsquo;s opponent uses a weapon and the martial artist scores three
more successes than his opponent&rsquo;s relevant weapon Ability, the martial artist
may disarm the target rather than clinching her.</p>
<p>After successfully clinching his enemy, the martial artist&rsquo;s player attempts a
resisted roll of (Dexterity + Martial Arts) against the opponent&rsquo;s (Strength +
[Melee or Martial Arts]).  The normal grappling rules still apply. If the Exalt
uses the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form when activating this Charm, he may
attempt as many of these reflexive grapples with animated sashes or trailing
robe hems as that Charm allows him to animate. If the martial artist grapples
his opponent with a prop animated by that Form-type Charm, turning the tables
on the grapple in the subsequent resisted roll does not grant the opponent any
control over the martial artist.  Instead, she&rsquo;ll just be left holding a limp
sash or a ripped-off piece of a loose sleeve. The cost of this Charm must be
spent for each reflexive grapple the Exalt attempts.</p>

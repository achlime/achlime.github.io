        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Martial Artist is a proficient but physically demanding lover, driving her
target to degrees of exertion that are as taxing as they are rewarding.  The
Martial Artist readily applies this principle in combat.  This charm benefits a
Hold action taken while in control of a Clinch.  Overwhelmed with pleasure, the
target rolls (Stamina + Resistance) against a difficulty of the Martial
Artist&rsquo;s (Martial Arts) score.  Failure imposes -1 point of fatigue penalty as
a Crippling effect.  As long as the Martial Artist retains control of the
clinch, and does not Crush the target, but rather Holds them, they must make
this check each time they loose the contested roll for control of the clinch.</p>
<p>If the target&rsquo;s Fatigue Penalties rise beyond their (Stamina + Resistance) they
immediately fall unconscious and the Martial Artist rolls (Manipulation +
Martial Arts) against the target&rsquo;s MDV.  The target&rsquo;s MDV is modified by the
relative Appearance modifier as if this was a social attack. If this roll
succeeds, the target awakes with an intimacy of Lust towards the Martial
Artist.  This is an Emotion effect that can be resisted for 2wp or 1wp if the
character is not attracted to the Martial Artist&rsquo;s Gender or Species.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the Clinch was an unexpected attack, they are subject to an
Illusion effect that causes them to remember their encounter with the Martial
Artist as a passionate and vigorous love-making session rather than a martial
engagement.  This illusion effect cannot be resisted without resisting the
Emotion effect and if the Emotion effect is resisted the Illusion evaporates as
well. This charm exerts unnatural mental influence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>One of the most common mishaps in the industrial world of the Alchemical Exalted is accidental blinding by exposure to unbearably bright arcs of energy. The martial artist learns to mimic this tragedy in a more direct fashion, throwing a shower of white-hot sparks as a counterattack in response to any attack she defended against with an unarmed parry using a close combat weapon that does not inflict bashing damage. She may choose any target for the sparks within (Essence) yards and need not choose the attacker who prompted the Charm, resolving her counterattack using the normal traits for the weapon with which she parried. If her counterattack would inflict any damage, her victim is instead blinded (as per <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 152). The blistered eyes of the Exalted repair themselves after a full day, but mortal eyes boil away completely to leave behind smoking sockets.</p>

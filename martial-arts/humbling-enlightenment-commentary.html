        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The grace of the crane inspires those who bear witness to it. A martial artist who knows this Charm may enhance her unarmed Martial Arts attacks and parries with the same descriptions as a social attack, provided that her spoken words analyze her opponent&rsquo;s fighting techniques and offers helpful advice to improve them. Thus, comments by players speaking in character provide a one-die stunt, et cetera. Social and conventional physical criteria do not stack as such, though a combination of visual and literal poetry may certainly net a higher stunt award at Storyteller discretion.</p>
<p>As a secondary benefit, if the martial artist takes a dramatic action lasting one minute in which she spars with a single individual, both combatants treat that minute as a day of training time for the purposes of purchasing dots of Martial Arts, Martial Arts specialties or Martial Arts Charms. This acceleration is not a Training effect and does not allow purchase of traits the combatant&rsquo;s player lacks the banked experience points to afford.</p>

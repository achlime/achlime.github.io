            <p>Sidereals are known for their discretion, never sullying the courts of the Lawgivers with the blood of would-be assassins or the screams of intercepted fanatics. Their killing arts are cleaner than that. This Charm supplements an unarmed martial arts attack. Should it successfully strike its target, that individual&rsquo;s breath is sealed, and he begins suffocating (see Exalted, p. 130). The target may make a reflexive (Strength + Athletics) roll every thirty seconds at a difficulty of the martial artist&rsquo;s Essence rating to attempt to break free and resume breathing normally. Until he does so, he suffers a -2 internal penalty to all actions. The martial artist may also restore a target&rsquo;s breath by striking them with this Charm again.</p>
<p>If used by a Sidereal Exalt, then this Charm may alternately be used to steal the target&rsquo;s breath altogether. The Sidereal may subsequently try to strangle the target with her own breath, treating such attempts as a dire chain-assisted grapple attempt. Should the target regain her breath, this weapon vanishes from the Sidereal&rsquo;s grasp.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Masters of the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan style straddle the Blossom of the
Perfected Lotus. Invoking this charm enlightens every little god of the Exalt&rsquo;s
equipment, and they sing out a single note of piercing beauty before being
consumed by colorless fire, which burns in the shape of a lotus. Swirling light
shines out from the Exalt as her clothes and accouterments merge with her body
as her form morphs and shifts into the Chimera-beast of her dreams. The Chimera
need not appear like SotM, p. 90-91, but it always has some similar trappings,
be it spiraling horns, carp fins, or flashing scales, and is always eminently
inhuman and obviously a dreaming Chimera. In Heaven, the registries show that a
new god has been born. (This is a shaping effect on the martial artist).</p>
<p>Gold-veined pearl scales cover the Exalt&rsquo;s entire form, providing an additional
6L/12B armor. If she so wishes, the martial artist floats just above the
ground, enablin her to hover or swim through the air with serpentine grace at
45 miles per hour. Her serpentine grace grants her a +3 bonus to Damage. While
using this Charm, the Exalt cannot be surprised or lied to, as secrets echo on
the wind for her alone and others&rsquo; intentions play out like uncoiling prayer
strips in her mind&rsquo;s eye. Also, the Exalt can perform a number of actions per
&lsquo;actual&rsquo; action equal to her Essence. (Each &lsquo;actual&rsquo; action taken thus is Speed
6.) These granted actions are full extra actions, not parts of a flurry, though
any of them can also be subdivided into a flurry. This Charm is incompatible
with other extra-action Charms.</p>
<p>Woe to the creature which would stand before the might of the Chimera and not
have a method to escape her wrath, for as the Chimera strikes the holes in her
opponent&rsquo;s defense materialize as gauzy nettles on her form, until the climax
of her attacks scatter their soul to the stars.</p>
<p>This Charm lasts for as long as the Exalt wishes, and she must spend a point of
temporary Willpower each scene it is active. Invoking it is risky, however. A
martial artist who learns this Charm comes dangerously close to the Blossom of
the Perfected Lotus, without necessarily the wisdom to control such esoteric
forces. The Exalt thrills to an ecstatic bliss in this form, and many who have
done so forgot they were once mortal. To end the charm, the character must
succeed at a Willpower roll with a difficulty equal to the number of scenes she
has kept the charm active. If the Exalt reaches zero temporary Willpower while
this charm is active the charm ends and, due to the extreme Willpower necessary
to control the esoteric forces of the Chimera, finds herself unable to recover
temporary Willpower for a complete week.</p>
<p><em>It is the modifiers intention to finishe this Charm tree with an Essence 5
charm. Most likely a permanent Charm or an upgrade to Invoking the Chimera&rsquo;s
Coils</em></p>

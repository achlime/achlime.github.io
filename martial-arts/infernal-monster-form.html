        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Infernal&rsquo;s eyes close and his face assumes a curiously sad expression, as if he almost regrets the carnage about to follow. When they open, they burn vivid emerald and his muscles swell impossibly, increasing his overall size and mass by 10%. Style-compatible armor resizes with him, but most clothes tear unless very loose-fitting. Use of this Charm is compatible with Lunar tattoos. The martial artist gains the benefits listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every unarmed attack inflicts piercing damage and grants the monster a cumulative dot of Strength for the scene. This dot does increase the damage of the attack that provided it. No combination of Charms including Infernal Monster Form can provide more than (Essence) additional dots, and this bonus is treated as a dice bonus from Charms. This Strength gain occurs even if the attack misses but only occurs once per attack regardless of the number of targets.</li>
<li>He can parry lethal and ranged attacks unarmed without a stunt.</li>
<li>He decreases the Speed of all unarmed attacks by -1, to a minimum of Speed 3, provided he attacks once rather than as part of a flurry.</li>
<li>His body expands metaphysically as well as physically, causing him to exist outside of fate and as a creature of darkness native to Malfeas for the duration of the Charm. These states carry all the usual advantages and disadvantages. In addition to basic removal from fate, the character&rsquo;s presence imposes automatic failure on all thaumaturgical divination methods (such as astrology) used within a mile, causing them to return a single disturbing result: &ldquo;The monster is here.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Exalt opens his mouth and probes the air with his tongue, tasting the air for blood as he awakens his primal hunger for flesh and Essence. For the rest of the scene, the martial artist can see dematerialized entities within a range of (Essence x 5) yards. This effect does not, in itself, enable the character to attack such entities. He also perceives which entities in that range possess Essence pools. Some Abyssals see an active Essence as a network of fine, glowing veins overlain on a target; others perceive the Essence pool as the person&rsquo;s audible heartbeat, a rich taste of blood on the tongue, an odor or some other sensation.</p>
<p>While using this Charm, an Abyssal can size up one chosen target within range as a miscellaneous action. Doing so costs one mote but does not count as Charm usage. Sizing up a target reveals the target&rsquo;s current wound penalty, her permanent Essence and the total number of available motes remaining in that character&rsquo;s combined Essence pools. For the rest of the scene, the martial artist senses any Essence expenditure by the target, though Blood-Scenting Hunger does not reveal the purpose for the Essence use. If the martial artist wants to know how an opponent suffered from an attack or how much Essence she spent from a Charm, however, he must spend another mote and take another action to re-assess wound penalties and Essence pools.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Each moment’s survival is a small happiness to one who walks constantly with peril and misfortune. While Joy in Adversity Stance is active, the martial artist gains one bonus die on her next unarmed Martial Arts attack every time she successfully dodges an attack. Attacks with the Overwhelming tag instead confer two dice when dodged. These bonus dice count as dice added by a Charm, and are discharged at when the martial artist next attacks.</p>
<p>Attacks must be made with hostile intent against the martial artist and be capable of harming her in order to trigger this Charm. Using a defense with a Flaw of Invulnerability ends this Charm’s duration prematurely.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The sensual martial artist&rsquo;s props and robes take on a life of their own,
enhancing and complementing her movements.  At her command, her fans open and
swirl enticingly about her body like butterflies. Her sashes tease and coil
around her like a lover&rsquo;s hands, and her flowing sleeves and robes writhe and
twist at her whim. The Exalt does not have to physically manipulate these props
in order to create this effect.</p>
<p>The martial artist controls one prop per dot of Essence she has (deciding which
props to animate when she activates the Charm). For example, an Exalt with an
Essence score of 4 could control one fan, one sash, one of her flowing sleeves
and the hem of her cloak, or she could control four fans at once. If the
martial artist wishes to add or change a prop, she must drop the present
invocation of this Charm and reactivate it.</p>
<p>Objects the martial artist wishes to command must be in her possession, and she
cannot make an attack with these props unless she is manually controlling them.
To attack with them yet still leave her hands free requires her to use the
Flurry of August Leaves Concentration Charm. While her character uses this
Charm, the Exalt&rsquo;s player adds her character&rsquo;s Martial Arts score to all
Presence and Socialize rolls, including those required for social combat and
the activation of Charms.</p>

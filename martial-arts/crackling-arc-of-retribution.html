        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Those who would assault representatives of Autochthonia&rsquo;s order will face the wages of their own dissidence. The Flashing Wire insinuates an oscillating tremor into his whips, causing them to hum and visibly sizzle through the air as though transmuted into bolts of lightning rather than merely conducting them. Until the end of the character&rsquo;s next action (i.e., the action following the activation of this Charm), her whips have Speed 3, Rate equal to their wielder&rsquo;s Martial Arts rating and the cost to add electrocution damage to an attack with Live Wire Form is zero motes rather than one mote. As a final benefit, if the martial artist has any empty hands when she activates this Charm, the appropriate number of whips formed of actual lightning appear in her grip for her to wield for the duration of the Charm. These weapons use standard whip traits plus the benefits above.</p>

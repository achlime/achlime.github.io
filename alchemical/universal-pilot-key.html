        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Alchemical has two pairs of retractible tendrils coiled in ports mounted on his forearms and inner calves. When he activates this Charm while piloting an artifact vehicle, these needle-tipped tentacles extend and interface directly with the essence-powered workings of the vehicle, letting the Champion bypass the need for physical controls. While directly interfaced into the ship or vehicle, the Alchemical can make piloting rolls to control it as a reflexive action, and adds +2 to the Maneuverability of the vehicle. The Alchemical can still take actions normally without it interfering with his control of the vehicle, but moving from the spot where he activated the Charm (as with a Move or dash action) forcibly disconnects the tendrils of this Charm, causing it to deactivate.</p>

        <p>This submodule is obsolete with the extinction of Estasian riding rats, but may find new uses should the Seal of Eight Divinities be breached. It enables the Alchemical to interface with living mounts using this Charm (dealing a single level of unsoakable lethal damage as its needles penetrate the flanks of a steed). Interfaced mounts have their Control rating reduced by two instead of receiving a Maneuverability bonus, to a minimum of control 0. Should the Alchemical wish to interface with an unwilling mount, he must roll (Dexterity + Martial Arts) as an attack to implant the tendrils.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A gimbaled assembly is installed around the Alchemical&rsquo;s Tunnel-Fighting Tactical Omnibus Implant, allowing for limited prescient situational modeling, assisted by a supplementary connection to the Design of Autochthon. When activated, this Charm allows the Alchemical to more efficiently defend a complementary unit in close formation in which he is a special character. The Champion is a blur, sweeping arrows from the air with his blade or allowing blows intended for terrified soldiers to bounce off his mighty armor. This Charm makes sure that the overwhelming majority of soldiers shed by a unit due to damage or Magnitude loss survive the experience. Their fate is diverted from death to disorganization or flight, allowing them to be collected or rallied for numbers later.</p>
<p>If this Charm faces a conflicting effect that guarantees that defeated soldiers within the Exalt&rsquo;s unit die, it adds the Alchemical&rsquo;s Compassion in automatic successes to the contested roll.</p>

            <h4>Riot-Dispersion Attack</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Charisma 5</span>, 3xp):</span>
        <p>Whenever a unit enhanced by this Charm attacks another unit, the benefits of the Charm may be extended to the enemy. No one is killed by the attack, but the unit is scattered and members may suffer injuries as a result of casualties as normal. Yet, this damage is capped as necessary to whatever number of levels will not prove fatal. Use of this bonus is optional and must be declared in Step One of the attack.</p>

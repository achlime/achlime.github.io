        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The modularity of Alchemical Charms is at once the greatest strength and greatest limitation of Autochthon&rsquo;s Champions. While they can expand the breadth of their competence quite cheaply compared to their cousins in Creation and can optimize themselves for specific missions, they remain completely dependent on vats access to employ these strengths. They must also carefully ration limited Personal Essence reserves among installation costs to determine how many Charms they can install at once.</p>
<p>Unlike most Alchemical Charms, a Transorganic Desecration Cyst doesn&rsquo;t require vats access to acquire. If the Exalt is willing to pursue power at any cost, her player can decide that this desire catalyzes as an unnatural growth in the Exalt&rsquo;s brain or Essence reservoir over the course of three days (equal to the Charm&rsquo;s minimum Attribute requirement). &ldquo;Learning&rdquo; the Charm costs 14 experience points (or 12 experience points with Stamina Favored) and does not use up a Charm slot or require any installation cost. Because it is not installed, the cyst can&rsquo;t be removed or otherwise swapped out, which means characters gain permanent Gremlin Syndrome along with the Charm if they don&rsquo;t already have that mutation. The Storyteller must approve the acquisition of this Charm.</p>
<p>Once an Alchemical has this Charm, she can grow any other Alchemical Charms using the same rules and experience costs as acquiring this Charm. Such Charms can&rsquo;t be removed and have no installation cost, but non-Internal Charms grown this way show the perverse aesthetics of mechanized wickedness that defines Voidtech. The Alchemical&rsquo;s player should work out specific descriptions of this degradation with the Storyteller. Charms gained this way grow into place with all submodules the character has already purchased for them. The Exalt can also spend a day and the usual experience to grow a new submodule out of a transorganic Charm. Extruded Voidtech can&rsquo;t be grown into an Array, but Apostates may develop standard Combos as other Exalted types do.</p>
<p>Enlightened Jadeborn and non-Alchemical Exalted may acquire this Charm and can grow other Alchemical Charms with submodules, paying the Eclipse caste anima power rate of 16 experience points per Charm and twice the listed cost for submodules. Non-Alchemicals must have visited Autochthonia or otherwise been in the immediate presence of the Great Maker or a component subgod for any chance of infection by a Transorganic Desecration Cyst. Damaged magitech artifacts of Autochthonian origin may also carry traces of the taint at Storyteller discretion, infecting those who try and fail to repair them.</p>

            <h4>Retromorphic Dynamic Physiology</h4> (6xp):</span>
        <p>Alchemicals with this submodule may also increase their Attributes or Essence without needing vats access, bypassing these limitations through defiance of established patterns. Alchemicals using this submodule must spend the same time as such upgrades would require with vats access, during which their bodies rest unconscious within a cocoon of tumors and wire that adds +5B/5L natural soak while the change goes on. The Exalt cannot prematurely awaken in the face of injury, so Void Lords must choose their lairs carefully when planning upgrades. Non-Alchemicals can already grow these traits on their own and do not need this submodule.</p>

            <h4>Abscissic Evolution Upgrades</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Intelligence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>This submodule metastasizes the Transorganic Desecration Cyst throughout the Alchemical&rsquo;s body, allowing it to grow permanent Void-keyword mutations. Each takes a day to grow into place and costs variable experience points according to the scope of the mutation: pox (1), affliction (3), blight (6), abomination (8). All mutations acquired this way must clearly express the twisted aesthetics of Voidtech. <a class="complex" href="integrated-artifact-transmogrifier.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier'"><span class="link-focus">Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier</span></a> (see pp. 154-155) can hide these mutations as if they were Charms.</p>

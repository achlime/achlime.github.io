        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>White jade circuitry imprinted onto the surface of the brain circumvents its logic centers to automatically reject certain lines of argument. This Charm is identical to <a class="complex" href="../solar/righteous-lion-defense.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Righteous Lion Defense'"><span class="link-focus">Righteous Lion Defense</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 199), with the following change: Rather than making inviolate an Intimacy to one of his visions or ideals, the Alchemical must choose an Intimacy dedicated to the service of something larger than himself. This duty may be to a society, an organization, a social class or even a mission, but it cannot be an individual and must not originate with the Exalt. The greater good reinforced by this Charm can benefit the Alchemical, but only as he is a component of that good. If society prospers, the Exalt may prosper, but this Charm affords no protection if he seeks his prosperity over the good of others or ignores his duty in order to pursue selfish ends.</p>

            <h4>Multimodal Duty Integrator</h4> (3x):</span>
        <p>Normally, the Charm can be installed only once. With this submodule, it may be installed up to (Compassion) times, as long as all of the reinforced Intimacies are interconnected components of the same greater good (as approved by the Storyteller).</p>

            <h4>Herald Infuser</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>As a diceless miscellaneous action, the Champion may touch a character who shares the reinforced Intimacy. That character also gains the benefits of the Charm for as long as it remains installed in the Alchemical. The Exalt may enchant up to (Compassion) individuals this way and must choose which beneficiary to replace when he goes past this limit.</p>

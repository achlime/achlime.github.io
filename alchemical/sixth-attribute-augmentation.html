        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>ALchemical Exalted rarely concern themselves with training to the same degree as the Chosen of Creation. Like most aspects of Alchemical existence, such competency may be installed and summarily discarded when no longer convenient. This Charm may be installed repeatedly for any Attribute. Each installation links the Attribute in question to expressions of a particular Ability, meaning 225 versions of this Charm technically exist. In the case of Craft, installation covers all possible actions involving all possible Craft variations in conjunction with a particular Attribute. In practice however, the (Strength + Socialize) model sees considerably less use than common Attribute/Ability pairings such as (Dexterity + Melee) or (Charisma + Presence).</p>
<p>Whenever an Alchemical with this Charm takes an action using its Attribute/Ability pair, she replaces her normal rating in that Ability with its maximum rating and treats this value as a natural trait. The actual Ability rating does not change outside of valid actions, so this Charm can&rsquo;t be used to bypass the requirements for Martial Arts Charms (or other Ability-based Charms in the case of Eclipse Castes).</p>
<p>If a character has a maximum natural rating in an Ability and retains vat access, she may trade out obsolete purchases of this Charm for another Alchemical Charm based on the same Attribute at no experience cost, removing the Augmentation from her panoply to substitute the replacement. This can&rsquo;t be done if the obsolete Augmentation is part of an Array, however. All experience spent on submodules for a traded-out Charm is refunded but can be spent only toward Acquisition of Alchemical Charms or submodules.</p>
<p>Example: With a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) installation, an Alchemical with Essence 3, Dexterity 4 and Martial Arts 2 is considered to have Martial Arts 5 whenever she takes an action using that Attribute/Ability pair. She still uses her Martial Arts 2 when pairing the Ability with any other Attribute. Once she reaches Essence 6, her effective Martial Arts rating will be 6 rather than 5 in accordance with the trait&rsquo;s higher maximum.</p>

            <h4>Synthetic Competency Upgrade</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>Each installation of this submodule provides one dot of a specialty for the Ability the Charm enhances. This bonus applies whenever the action uses the specific Attribute/Ability pair within the purview of the specialty. There is no limit to the number of times this submodule may be installed, but no specific specialty may be installed more than three times. Furthermore, all applicable specialty bonuses stack to a maximum of +3, regardless of the breadth of the Alchemical&rsquo;s competence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Exalt has a sensor built into his fingertip connecting to his Optical Shroud. By touching another being and activating this Charm, the Champion may attune that character to his cloaking system. Separate activations can concomitantly apply this blessing to up to (Appearance + Essence) individuals. Whenever a character tagged this way is within 50 yards of the Alchemical and Optical Shroud is activated, the effected character cloaks as well, including all upgrades from submodules. They remain cloaked as long as the Exalt maintains his own invisibility or until they break out of its concealment via sudden or violent movement. Reactivation of that Charm gathers them back into the effect and hides them once more. As an additional benefit, all characters hidden by the same Champion&rsquo;s cloaking system can ignore it and perceive one another normally, though they can distinguish that they are all hidden.</p>

        <p>The Alchemical may attune an entire military unit with Magnitude equal to or less than his Essence rating in lieu of an individual, paying five motes and five Willpower to do so. For the unit to enjoy the benefits of cloaking, the Champion must be a special character in the unit, the unit must have Drill 3+ and it must remain in close formation. Once any member breaks out of the cloak via attack, changing formation or the like (including actions by special characters), the entire unit appears and requires reactivation of Hidden Assembly Conclave to hide again.</p>

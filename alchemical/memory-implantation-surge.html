        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm expands the function of Identity Recalibration Signal, adding the following options to the list of actions the Alchemical may take while crushing a victim:</p>
<p><em>Craft Memory</em>: She may alter the victim&rsquo;s memory by dedicating consecutive actions to doing so. One action suffices to make superficial changes, such as &ldquo;you arrived to work on time today,&rdquo; where in fact the subject had been late to his shift but had not been discovered or reprimanded. Two actions allow gross changes that need not mesh with associative memory continuity. For example, &ldquo;You Exalted as one of the Anathema this afternoon,&rdquo; where in fact the subject took a nap. Three actions allow one sweeping change that permeates throughout the victim&rsquo;s memory, such as &ldquo;You were the son of a Dynast,&rdquo; where the subject is a peasant. Four actions allow for the complete rewriting of a segment of memory up to five years long, while five consecutive actions allow the Alchemical to completely reconfigure the victim&rsquo;s life story. Victims confronted with evidence of false memories may spend one Willpower to remember the truth behind them for one scene. Once a victim has spent a total of 10 Willpower this way (or five Willpower if an Essence user), her memories are fully restored. Spending Willpower this way is considered resisting unnatural mental influence.</p>
<p><em>Restore Memory</em>: The Alchemical may restore false or deleted memories she has located. She does not have the option of previewing the truth behind such mental alterations before returning them to her patient, although the option of altering them again remains available if they prove inconvenient.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm takes the form of a delicate half torc anchored by a rivet in the throat. The Champion makes a social attack against a single target within one yard using ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence), in which he extols the virtues of his Motivation. Any Virtue channel applied to this attack adds successes instead of dice. If the attack succeeds, the target&rsquo;s Motivation is temporarily suppressed and replaced by the Alchemical&rsquo;s own Motivation. Immediately and at any point thereafter, the target may pay four Willpower to reassert her own values. (This cost can be paid in installments.) Alternatively, the target can change his own Motivation to accept the imposed purpose as a true change. Not only does this change not cost experience, but the sense of renewed purpose restores all spent Willpower the first time this happens in a scene. Slight changes in the wording of a Motivation are permitted where logical—such as an Alchemical with a Motivation of &ldquo;Be the greatest weapons inventor in history&rdquo; imposing &ldquo;Help [Alchemical Name] be the greatest weapon inventor in history.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The Charm may be used at standard speaking range for a social attack. A second installation of this submodule at Essence 6 allows it to be used in conjunction with a Performance based attack, but an areaeffect use wears off on its own after a day, even if unresisted.</p>

        <p>This voidtech submodule improves the power of Motivational Vocoder (see p. 147) to enslave other creatures of the Void. Against such targets, Virtue channeling is impossible, but the character adds bonus successes equal to his Essence rating. If the target is a gremlin with equal or lower Essence and succumbs to the Charm, the Apostate may give it any Motivation he desires, and it cannot even spend Willpower to escape until it goes more days than its master&rsquo;s Manipulation rating without interacting with him. Until the gremlin escapes or the Apostate reinstalls his Motivational Vocoder without this submodule, the gremlin must obey him like a demon bound to his service (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 252–253), though the Intimacy behind the obedience is hateful fear rather than loyalty. The Intimacy remains and shifts to pure hate if the gremlin breaks free, and it acts accordingly. When targeting a gremlin it can bind, the Charm can be used in personal combat with a Speed measured in ticks rather than long ticks, as a single imperious command assaults the spirit&rsquo;s mind.</p>

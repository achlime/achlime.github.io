        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>One of the Champion&rsquo;s eyes is replaced with a remote drone, outwardly identical to his other eye. When this Charm is activated, the eye slides out of its housing and a clearly prosthetic duplicate pushes its way forward from the back of the socket, preserving the Exalt&rsquo;s binocular vision. The disembodied eye unbraids its optic nerve into spindly leg-tendrils ending in needle tips (with the traits listed in the accompanying sidebar). The drone has no volition or memory and must be issued a constant stream of telepathic orders to know where to go and what specific actions to take. Controlling the drone thus requires a diceless miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -2) from the Alchemical each action, relaying the drone&rsquo;s own sensory input back to its creator during that action.</p>
<p>Absent such control, the drone waits. Wards that block scrying negate this link, and the automaton will automatically retreat out of such fields by the quickest route possible to restore communication. It has an effective transmission range equal to its creator&rsquo;s Essence rating in miles. Ending this Charm or the drone&rsquo;s premature destruction causes it to sublimate into Essence, with a new replacement growing over five hours. Ordering the construct to reflexively reenter into its home socket ends the Charm without imposing a wait time for reactivation. While it exists, the drone acts as an arcane link to its creator.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="riftslide-tesseract-device">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Riftslide Tesseract Device</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 5</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>A Mobile Sensory Drone socket (see pp. 161-162) enhanced with this voidtech submodule becomes a travel device. The Apostate must spend two consecutive actions controlling the drone without placing either action in a flurry. When his DV refreshes after the second action, he can spend 10 motes and one Willpower. Doing so causes the drone to leap into the air and burst into a momentary rip in the Design through which the Apostate teleports. He cannot use this means of travel if there is insufficient space to receive him. Attacks made against him on the tick in which he teleports automatically miss.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="extra-drones">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Extra Drones</h4> (5xp):</span>
        <p>Another of the Alchemical&rsquo;s eyes has been transformed into a drone. Installations in excess of the Exalt&rsquo;s available eye sockets can be mounted anywhere on the body and do not appear as eyes so much as spherical metal rivets. Multiple drones can be fashioned with a single activation at a cost of five motes per drone, and the Charm gains the Stackable keyword. Because each drone requires its own stream of orders, the Autonomous submodule is a worthwhile investment. This submodule may be installed any number of times.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="playback">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Playback</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Intelligence 3</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>The drone records everything it experiences in a memory crystal, allowing the Alchemical to safely ignore its sensory feed. When returned to its socket, these memories integrate into the Alchemical&rsquo;s mind. The destruction of the drone obliterates its memories.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="autonomous">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Autonomous</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Intelligence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The drone has Intelligence 2 and can remember instructions, allowing it to operate without ongoing input. At the start of each action tick, the Alchemical must choose whether to open the link to receive sensory input and potentially transmit new orders. Doing so provides those benefits but also imposes a one-die internal penalty to all of the Chosen&rsquo;s non-reflexive actions until his DV refreshes from the strain of multitasking. Although they are intelligent enough to accept complicated instructions, the drones have no ingenuity or true independent initiative and never do anything they have not been tasked specifically with doing.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="communication">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Communication</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Charisma 3</span> or <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The drone can receive and transmit the Alchemical&rsquo;s voice. Alternatively, it can telepathically broadcast the Exalt&rsquo;s words to anyone touching it, preventing the transmissions from being overheard. Social attacks made this way use the Alchemical&rsquo;s own traits as if he were present at the drone&rsquo;s location, and he may enhance them with his own Charms normally. Unless he possesses the Autonomous submodule, however, he must make those attacks as part of a flurry following an action to control the drone.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="hovering">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Hovering</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Dexterity 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>An antigravitic capacitor allows the drone to fly and hover at the same rate as it can crawl, spinning its legs on a rotary engine for dashing thrust. A second installation doubles the speed of all locomotion.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="kamikaze-assassin">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Kamikaze Assassin</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Strength 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The drone may be commanded to overload its internal Essence battery and pounce on an enemy within one yard, stabbing with its electrified needle legs. This submodule gives the drone a close combat attack with these traits: Speed 3, Accuracy 10, Damage (creator&rsquo;s Strength)L, Defense N/A, Rate Special (destroys the drone at the conclusion of resolution), Tags P.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="upgraded-senses">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Upgraded Senses</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Perception 5</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The drone&rsquo;s own senses are upgraded by all Charms the Alchemical has active.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="stealth">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Stealth</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The drone can camouflage itself with a permanent effect duplicating the Charm <a class="complex" href="optical-shroud.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Optical Shroud'"><span class="link-focus">Optical Shroud</span></a> (see pp. 156-157). Attacking deactivates this effect until the drone&rsquo;s DV refreshes. If the Alchemical actually has that Charm in his panoply, the drone&rsquo;s cloaking system is upgraded by whatever submodules he has purchased. He need not have his Optical Shroud installed to share submodules this way.</p>

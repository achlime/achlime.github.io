        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The artificial bodies of the Alchemical Exalted are not limited to merely superhuman feats of Essence-driven prowess. This Charm is actually a vast multitude of different biomechanical implants, represented by purchasing mutations in bundled packages. Many of these packages, having been selected again and again over the centuries by Autochthonia&rsquo;s industrial Champions, have developed discrete names and identities as Charms. The (double installation of Tentacles) package, for example, comprises a bundle of telescoping or moonsilver limbs attached to hardpoints in the Alchemical&rsquo;s back and sides and is commonly known as the Hyperdexterous Tentacle Apparatus.</p>
<p>Each purchase of this Charm produces a bundle of eight mutation points and must be installed separately. If any mutations in the package substantially alter the humanoid structure of the Alchemical&rsquo;s body (i.e., having one head, two arms and two legs conventionally arranged from a central torso), that installation has Exemplar 1, and the Storyteller is final arbiter of this. Mutations acquired via this Charm are always Obvious in some way and remain active at all times. All mutations acquired with this Charm must have a mechanical appearance and rationale appropriate to the aesthetics of Alchemical Charms, as approved by the Storyteller. Claws could be installed as whirling drill bits or vibrating saws, hooves as reinforced piston feet, et cetera. The Alchemical is free to concurrently install as many iterations of this Charm as his Essence reserves can sustain.</p>

        <p>This voidtech submodule improves Manifold Transhuman Implants (see pp. 167-168), allowing each installation of the Charm to contain up to (Essence rating) points of negative mutations in its package. Each point of negative mutations added this way allows the package to contain an additional two points of positive mutations, increasing its power at the cost of insanity, physical deterioration or worse.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A tiny crystal nodule wrapped in hair-thin filaments of red and green jade is implanted in the Exalt&rsquo;s brain. When tapped, this vast database of sexual techniques and provocative innuendo allows the Alchemical to project a subconscious impression of focused carnal intent, making her an object of intense desire. She doubles the maximum MDV bonus or penalty she can inflict or benefit from based on difference in Appearance.</p>
<p>In addition to radiating sexuality, the Exalt becomes peerless at the art of lovemaking. Hypnotic body rhythms and inhuman muscle control first entrance partners during the act of consummation, then bring them to exhausting climax, leaving them smitten and easily influenced. Any social attack by the Alchemical whispered in the ear mid-coitus or up to one hour following worms deep into the target&rsquo;s psyche, acting as unnatural mental influence that costs two Willpower to resist. If the attack aims to create an Intimacy of lust or infatuation toward the Alchemical, the cost is three Willpower instead, and the attack is undodgeable. If the Exalt imposed unwanted sex on the target through physical force, none of these benefits apply.</p>

            <h4>Synthetic Bliss Engrams</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical&rsquo;s Thousandfold Courtesan Calculations enhance any post-coitus social attack meant to build an Intimacy of lust or infatuation towards him, causing the target to automatically form the Intimacy if he fails to defend or resist, no matter how high his Conviction.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="ultimate-ardor-upgrade">

        <p>With this submodule installed, there is no limit on the benefits from differing Appearance, so an Appearance 8 Alchemical receives a +7 MDV bonus when socially attacked by an Appearance 1 character, et cetera. The cost to resist a post-coital lust or infatuation Intimacy also increases to five Willpower, and the Charm&rsquo;s duration increases to Indefinite.</p>

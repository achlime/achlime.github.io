        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As a complex system of artificial flesh patches and other mechanisms, this Charm betrays no outward signs of its presence. It is designed to physically conceal non-Internal Alchemical Charms, giving as many of them as desired the Internal keyword for the duration of the effect. Affected devices retract and compress under the Exalt&rsquo;s skin through compartment panels, while her claylike flesh morphs and spreads to cover the area they previously occupied. As usual, <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#obvious" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Obvious'"><span class="link-focus">Obvious</span></a> Internal Charms reveals themselves for the duration of use, though only to the degree that is necessary to perform the Obvious function. To change which Charms are hidden, the Charm must be reflexively deactivated and then reactivated normally.</p>
<p>As a final benefit, if all of the Alchemical&rsquo;s Charms have the <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#internal" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Internal'"><span class="link-focus">Internal</span></a> keyword (whether naturally or from use of this Charm) and she is human-sized, she may transmute her claylike flesh and blood into a perfect simulacrum of human physiology and counter-gravitically compensate for the weight of hidden Charms so that her heavy tread does not betray her nature. In toto, the changes allow her to pass as mortal. An Exalt disguised this way may even retract or modify the appearance of her soulgem as a reflexive action.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="machine-cyst-concealment">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Machine-Cyst Concealment</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>With this voidtech submodule the Alchemical can activate his Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier to disguise his Void Charms, rather than internalizing them. Alchemical Charms corrupted by Voidtech submodules revert to their normal appearance, while <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#void" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Void'"><span class="link-focus">Void</span></a>-keyworded Charms are rendered seemingly mechanical in nature. Activating an Obvious Void Charm still reveals its true nature, and this concealment is overcome by any effect which bypasses the usual effect of Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier. If the Alchemical conceals all of his installed Void Charms, then his nature as an Apostate cannot be detected by any means.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="loom-server-migration">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Loom Server Migration</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 2xp):</span>
        <p>If the Alchemical activates the Charm in Creation or another realm of existence governed by the Loom of Fate, this <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#axiomatic" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Axiomatic'"><span class="link-focus">Axiomatic</span></a> submodule can send an autonomic prayer to the pattern spiders to indicate that he, a fellow servant of Autochthon, wishes orderly integration. The machine spirits then spin tattered strands from the broken constellation of the Mask around the Champion, bringing him fully into fate with an innocuous and unremarkable destiny for as long as the Charm remains active. He returns to the Design of Autochthon upon conclusion.</p>
<p>[NB: This submodule will not exist until Alchemicals encounter Creation and discover the horrifying fact that their unregistered presence disrupts the local weave, indirectly (and unintentionally) strengthening the Void.]</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="essence-muting-baffles">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Essence-Muting Baffles</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>While the Charm is active, all Internal Charms the Exalt has are invisible to Essence sight and other means of supernatural detection unless they are active and Obvious. If no Charms are eligible for detection this way, the Alchemical may choose to cloak the fact that she is an Essence user, in which case she seems to have Essence 1. Toggling the Essence cloak on and off is a reflexive action, but the cloak drops automatically and can&rsquo;t be maintained while her anima banner is flaring at all or is revealed by Obvious Charm use. If an opposing Charm seeks to penetrate an active Essence cloak, add the Exalt&rsquo;s Appearance rating as bonus dice to the roll-off.</p>
    </div>

        <p>The Charm&rsquo;s activation cost decreases to two motes.</p>

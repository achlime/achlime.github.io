        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm appears as a coin-shaped node on the left temple, formed of a gold-shifted rainbow alloy of starmetal and orichalcum. Its power enhances the Alchemical&rsquo;s capacity to assist a unit in which she is a special character other than the unit commander and the commander is another Alchemical. First, the Alchemical using the Charm counts simultaneously as a hero, a sorcerer and a relay, with all the best benefits and options afforded by each role. Second, the commander may use the Alchemical&rsquo;s War rating in place of his own, if the Alchemical&rsquo;s rating is higher. Third, whenever the unit acts, both the assisting Alchemical and the commander may aid the unit by activating one of their Charms, though this does not increase the number of actions the unit receives. No Combo is necessary to enjoy this cooperation, however, allowing both characters to apply a supplemental Charm to the same attack, for example. If multiple special characters have this Charm, only one of them may contribute his War rating and offer a Charm per action, though all count as triple-role officers as normal. Effects of this Charm persist only while the unit is arranged in close formation.</p>

        <p>The Champion may use this Charm to assist units led by non- Alchemicals, provided the unit leader is not a creature of the Void. Conversely, Apostates with this submodule can aid only those commanders who are fellow creatures of the Void.</p>

        <p>The Alchemical using the Charm may activate simple Charms to assist the unit on the unit&rsquo;s action without using up the unit&rsquo;s action. The Champion is still limited to only one Charm activation per unit action, whether simple or not.</p>

        <p>If a unit commander with this Charm and this submodule is being assisted by multiple characters who are also using this Charm, then the commander may use the best War rating among the officers. Up to five of them may independently supply an assisting Charm during each of the unit&rsquo;s actions.</p>

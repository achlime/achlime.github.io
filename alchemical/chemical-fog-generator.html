        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This bulky Charm fits snugly into the Alchemical&rsquo;s torso, with an assortment of vent tubes branching out to exhaust ports in the Exalt&rsquo;s skin and throat. When activated, the device churns out thick streamers of black smoke from as many of the vents as desired. The smoke billows into heavy clouds, rapidly filling a radius of (Essence) yards per mote spent. Up to a limit of (lower of Stamina or Manipulation) motes may be spent powering the Charm per action. The Stackable keyword permits the Alchemical to fill a progressively greater area with smoke by continuing to burn Essence, with smaller clouds adding their radius to the size of larger clouds with which they merge. The smoke lingers for one hour in still air, half that time in a light breeze, only (Stamina rating) minutes in a strong wind and one action in a hurricane gale. The Storyteller should extrapolate its longevity in other conditions using these guidelines.</p>
<p>The murky black cloud imposes vision penalties as fog (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 135), which means that defensive use applies appropriate visual penalties against the incoming attack. Additionally, the caustic, choking smoke acts as a poison to anyone caught within its radius who requires air. Characters holding their breath are unaffected until they are forced to breathe it. As a mild poison, the smoke has the following traits: (1B/1 hour, 2M, —/—, -1). Like all inhaled toxins, ongoing smoke inhalation only imposes a new dose every time the previous dose wears off and the victim is still breathing it. This means that initial contact runs its course after two hours, applying damage each hour as normal. After that time, a character still breathing it faces exposure for another two hours of being affected, et cetera.</p>
<p>Only one gas-based submodule may be applied to any use of the Charm. Mixing gas formulae using separate activations catalyzes the joint cloud into the unmodified smoke, allowing Alchemicals to use this Charm defensively to counter the poison clouds of their enemies.</p>

        <p>This faintly yellowish dense smoke produces dizziness along with burning pain in the eyes and lungs. Its traits are (1B/action, 2, —/—, -3), but its damage never spills over past Incapacitated to become lethal.</p>

            <h4>Clandestine Toxin System</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>As an alternative to standard smoke, the Charm may release a colorless, odorless gas that is not Obvious. Although this gas does not interfere with vision and has a difficulty equal to the Alchemical&rsquo;s Manipulation to notice with a standard (Perception + Awareness) roll, it is still as toxic as normal. In addition, the toxin does not take effect until characters have been exposed for the full period of one duration interval, though even momentary exposure assures that the toxin will take effect, even if the victim moves out of the gas before that time. In conjunction with other submodules such as Nerve Gas, use of the Clandestine Toxin System can result in enemies not realizing they have stumbled into a deadly atmosphere until it is too late.</p>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="vectored-toxin-deployment">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Vectored Toxin Deployment</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Strength 3</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>By paying two motes per (Essence rating) yards of radius and one Willpower, the Charm can gather plumes of smoke into a tight ball around the projectile of a ranged attack in Step One. Wherever the Alchemical&rsquo;s projectile hits, the smoke concentrate billows out to fill its usual radius. Attacking the ground to catch many enemies in the radius is often easier than attacking one of them directly, as the Exalt needs only a single attack success to place the projectile where desired.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>For areas of endeavor integral to an Alchemical&rsquo;s designated legend, temporary boosting via mote expenditure is too inefficient. This Charm may purchased for any of the Alchemical&rsquo;s Attributes and may be installed up to (Essence ÷ 2, rounded up) times per Attribute, though the Exalt need commit Personal Essence to only the first installation. Each installation increases the maximum value that the Exalt can have for the Attribute in question and provides one additional do of that trait. Attribute dots supplied by this Charm do not count toward the experience cost to raise the Attribute, but count as natural dots for all other purposes, including raising the cap for other Attribute Augmentations. The enhancements provided by this Charm are Obvious at all times; the glittering web of electromorphic filaments tracing the head of an Alchemical with boosted Intelligence are every bit as distinctive as the pneumatic musculature of an Exalt with improved Strength.</p>
<p>Example: An Alchemical with Dexterity 4, Essence 3 installs this Charm twice, raising the Attribute cap from 5 to 7 and raising his effective Dexterity to 6. If he refitted his Dexterity to take advantage of the unused dot of ceiling by improving the rating without this Charm, it would cost experience as if he were purchasing a fifth dot rather than a seventh.</p>

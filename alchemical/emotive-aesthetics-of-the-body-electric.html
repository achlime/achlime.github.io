        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Exalt&rsquo;s body and movements have received exacting calibration, enabling her to communicate intentions and have a profound impact on others without saying a word. She may make social attacks and otherwise communicate without speaking or taking any obvious action, providing the targets of such attacks can perceive her with at least one of their senses. Outside of combat, this Charm may be used to facilitate quick and subtle battlefield signaling, as well as any other such purpose approved by the Storyteller.</p>
<p>Observers who are not targeted by social attacks facilitated by this Charm can make a reflexive (Perception + Socialize) roll to realize communication is occurring. The difficulty is (6 – the number of silent communications they have already witnessed this scene) and requires that witnesses directly observe the emoting.</p>

            <h4>Dormancy Emotive Upgrade</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Perception 3</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical&rsquo;s ability to emote is so refined that she can affect others even while unconscious or otherwise rendered Inactive. The character remains immobile in such situations but remains aware as though awake and can respond to the situation at hand with social attacks. These attacks may be enhanced with other Charms normally, and the Exalt remembers everything she perceived and did upon awakening. Common examples of use include making a would-be assassin fall in love with the character or run away from her screaming.</p>

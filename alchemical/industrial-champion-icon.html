        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A rosette pattern of the magical materials surrounds the Exalt&rsquo;s soulgem, signifying her identity as an ordained Champion of faith and hierarchy, elevated above the forces of chaos and entropy. As long as this Charm is installed, all social attacks directed against creatures of the Void cost an additional Willpower to resist (to a maximum of five Willpower). The Exalt may also spend four motes in Step Two of combat resolution to perfectly dodge any mental influence that would make him act against the dictates of Clarity, whether to be more human or outright blasphemous to the Great Maker&rsquo;s Design. Use of this defense does not count as a Charm activation, but the Storyteller decides whether it is applicable.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="counter-dissonance-stabilizer">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Counter-Dissonance Stabilizer</h4> (6xp):</span>
        <p>Upon making a successful social attack against an Alchemical with temporary or permanent Gremlin Syndrome—provided the target does not resist the attack with Willpower expenditure—the attacker may commit one mote plus one mote for each time this effect has been used on that target in her life. The infusion suppresses Gremlin Syndrome for one week, converting Dissonance into Clarity while the motes remain committed. The suppression does not stack. One treatment must wear off before another may be applied. The target may deliberately revert to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; at any time by reflexively paying one Willpower.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="heresy-declaration-beacon">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Heresy Declaration Beacon</h4> (6xp):</span>
        <p>If he makes a close combat attack against an enemy who has taken actions that directly and meaningfully threaten the Design of Autochthon or the divine order of his worshipers&rsquo; society, the Alchemical may pay five motes and one Willpower in Step One. If the attack hits, filaments of light flash outward in every direction like spider webs, and the target becomes a creature of the Void as a Shaping effect, drawing a momentary red glare from all machine spirits who spin fate in the target&rsquo;s current realm of existence. The heretic can remove this label with a full month spent in penitent and rigorous observance of the Great Maker&rsquo;s laws as revealed to Autochthonia or the Jadeborn, a mercy not available to beings inherently associated with the Void.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm takes the form of a line of starmetal wires and nodes climbing the Alchemical&rsquo;s spine. It connects to an adamant calculating array inside his skull and to his Accelerated Response System. Faced with an attack or a form of threatening environmental damage, this array calculates a perfect evasive position and automatically shifts the Alchemical&rsquo;s body with clockwork precision to avoid harm. This effect acts as a perfect dodge against any attack of which the Exalt is aware. It does not allow him to avoid undodgeable attacks or environmental damage that could not conceivably be dodged, subject to Storyteller approval. (The Alchemical could theoretically weave his way unharmed through a rockslide, but he would have nowhere even temporarily safe to dodge if he were immersed in a pool of acid.) This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Alchemical Invulnerability.</p>

            <h4>Transphase Engine</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Dexterity 5</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>A series of orichalcum rods connect the Alchemical&rsquo;s Precalculated Evasion System and Essence reservoir. By paying an additional mote upon activation, this submodule makes him momentarily immaterial, allowing him to perfectly dodge undodgeable attacks and all-encompassing environmental effects. This rerouting of power makes the Precalculated Evasion System less accurate, however, affording only the Alchemical&rsquo;s usual DV against attacks capable of striking dematerialized targets. This submodule also allows the Alchemical to activate his Transphase Engine for utility purposes, such as to leap through any barrier thin enough to traverse with a tick&rsquo;s worth of movement.</p>

            <h4>Advanced Calculation Arrays</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 5</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>This submodule takes the form of an upgraded series of adamant calculation arrays in the Alchemical&rsquo;s skull. This system is so extensive that glassy crystalline spikes actually protrude from the Exalt&rsquo;s skull at several points. For an additional three-mote activation cost, it allows this Charm&rsquo;s duration to be upgraded from Instant to one tick.</p>

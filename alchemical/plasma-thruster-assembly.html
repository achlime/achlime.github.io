        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Exalt has a pair of heavily shielded nozzles mounted in the soles of his feet or in a retractable mechanism on his back. Regardless of their placement, the Charm has the same effect, propelling the Alchemical through the air at great speed on jets of glowing force. The Champion can carry up to one passenger of approximately the same size as himself, or an equivalent amount of cargo.</p>
<p>The Exalt can accelerate in a straight line, moving (Essence x 50) yards in a single burst once per action. Doing so normally costs two motes. If the Exalt uses this burst on an action tick to close the distance to an enemy and strike her with a close combat attack for added force, the cost increases to four motes and one Willpower and doubles the raw damage of that attack. In conjunction with a flurry, only the first attack may be enhanced this way. The character may also use the burst to fly a grappled enemy and slam her into a solid barrier for four motes and one Willpower, doubling the raw damage of a crush attack. As a defense, enemies can always get in a strike before the Exalt can take off, or even a flurry of attacks. Yet, each attack after the first in a flurry suffers a -2 external penalty from the Alchemical pulling away and thereby lessening the impact.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Charm allows for long-distance travel, costing 10 motes per hour of flight, or five motes if the Alchemical has some version of the Wings mutation installed to help keep him aloft. The Exalt travels at (Essence x 20) miles per hour, and any fine maneuvering requires a reflexive (Dexterity + Athletics) roll with a difficulty of 1–5 as set by the Storyteller for the type of maneuver and environmental conditions. Combat or other highly distracting physical activity aborts this travel mode and deactivates the Charm.</p>
<p>Everyone within one yard directly behind or beneath the Alchemical when he engages any mode of this Charm suffers automatic knockdown unless the character has a Dodge DV of 5+. Launching straight up affects everyone around the launch point.</p>

        <p>The Exalt may grab a willing ally in reach and hold him ahead when using burst flight, in order to enhance that ally&rsquo;s close combat attack.</p>

        <p>If the Alchemical bursts to strike an enemy with added force and hits, that enemy is also hurled back the remaining number of yards the burst could conceivably have carried the Exalt and suffers automatic knockdown. If the enemy hits a barrier before skidding to a halt, she suffers damage as per <a class="complex" href="../martial-arts/heaven-thunder-hammer.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Heaven Thunder Hammer'"><span class="link-focus">Heaven Thunder Hammer</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 242). This damage is capped at the terminal velocity limit of 25B.</p>

        <p>The Alchemical&rsquo;s flight system does not shut off when the character enters combat. The character still moves at full speed (40 yards per tick), though, and must plan accordingly, especially as crashing as a result of a failed maneuver roll results in a terminal velocity impact for 25B. The character gains the usual combat advantages of flight. The Champion can even use the Charm&rsquo;s burst mode while aloft to provide quick acceleration for that mode&rsquo;s usual purposes.</p>

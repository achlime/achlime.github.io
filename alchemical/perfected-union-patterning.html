        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Bands of the Champion&rsquo;s magical material are injected into the skin of her face, forming hypnotic patterns reminiscent of war paint. When suffused with Essence, the patterns reinforce attempts at forging unity. This Charm may supplement any social attack based on an Attribute for which the Exalt has an installed Augmentation, provided he attempts to convince one or more targets to favorably regard a social group separate from but roughly equivalent to a social group to which the targets belong. The attack can use Presence if only one target is present, but it must use Performance otherwise. If using Performance, only targets who are members of an equivalent group are affected by the Charm&rsquo;s power, though other witnesses could still be moved by the unmodified social attack. Those affected by the Charm feel as directed until they pay three Willpower to shake off the unnatural Emotion effect (or one Willpower if the selected social group has taken actions that directly damage their artificial reputation).</p>
<p>For example, the members of one work shift might be convinced to like members of a separate work shift, or citizens of one nation might become well inclined toward citizens of another nation. Non-equivalent groups are not valid targets, though. This Charm could not help convince a factory full of Populat workers to support their local Tripartite Assembly, for instance.</p>

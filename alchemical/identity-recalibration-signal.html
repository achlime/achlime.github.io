        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm expands its prerequisite, allowing the Alchemical the option of either &ldquo;holding&rdquo; or &ldquo;crushing&rdquo; a victim drawn into a mindscape when in control of the psychic clinch. &ldquo;Crush&rdquo; attacks constitute a form of unnatural mental influence costing one Willpower to resist. Resisting this influence merely assures the integrity of the victim&rsquo;s personality for a few more moments and does not end the clinch.</p>
<p>If the victim fails to fight off the probe&rsquo;s intrusion, the
Alchemical may modify his personality to be more agreeable.
She may apply one of the following modifications on each
&ldquo;crush&rdquo; action and wastes any action spent attempting an
impossible change:</p>
<p><em>Intimacies</em>: One Intimacy of the Alchemical&rsquo;s choice may be added, up to his normal limit. Alternatively one Intimacy of the target&rsquo;s choice is removed as an Illusion effect, and the Alchemical learns what Intimacy was erased.</p>
<p><em>Memory</em>: The victim can be made to forget a specific contiguous period of memory covering as much as five years or all memories associated with an Intimacy the Charm has excised. The Exalt does not learn the details of the memories she deletes. This is an Illusion effect.</p>
<p><em>Virtues</em>: Any of the victim&rsquo;s Virtues may be increased or decreased by one dot. This cannot shift them above 5 or below 1.</p>
<p><em>Willpower</em>: The victim gains or loses a dot of permanent Willpower (maximum 8, minimum 1).</p>
<p>When the Exalt is finished, the spike slides painlessly free. The effects are permanent as applied to mortals, who can recover lost dots of Virtues or Willpower by spending the requisite experience and a month per dot to heal their torn psyches. Essence users can pay four Willpower at any time to restore a diminished trait to its original rating instead and can pay this cost in installments. Adding Virtue or Willpower dots is a Training effect for mortals, but Essence users can choose to apply a Training effect or a one-day temporary boost when they gain a dot. Essence users can recover lost memories by seeking out reminders of them or otherwise spending scenes building an Intimacy to the memory. Once the Intimacy forms, it dissolves as the memory returns.</p>

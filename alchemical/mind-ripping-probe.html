        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm expands its prerequisite, adding the following options to the list of actions the Alchemical may take while crushing a victim&rsquo;s mind:</p>
<p><em>Essence Drain</em>: She may drain five motes from the victim, transferring the Essence to her own reservoirs. Stolen motes beyond her capacity to contain crackle in her anima as though she spent them from her Peripheral Essence pool. This option cannot drain more motes than the number of threshold successes the Alchemical received on the roll to maintain control of the mental clinch (minimum one).</p>
<p><em>Memory Extraction</em>: She may read the victim&rsquo;s memories, posing a question that is involuntarily answered as the target&rsquo;s mind flashes vignettes of pertinent experiences. If she reads a patch of blank or magically altered memories, she also recognizes them as such but does not gain any insight into what was originally there. Note that &ldquo;What memories are false?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you have gaps in your memory?&rdquo; are valid questions to locate tampering, since the victim&rsquo;s mind knows the answers even if it isn&rsquo;t aware that it does.</p>
<p><em>Spirit Absorption</em>: If the victim is a spirit of lesser Essence and has no motes remaining, the Alchemical may force it into a dematerialized state and implode its being through her spike and into her soul. The spirit effectively does not exist while contained in this fashion and cannot be interacted with, save that the Exalt can clinch the spirit using Personality Override Spike and successive Charms as though it were currently pierced for no activation cost. If the spirit wins control of the grapple, it merely buys itself a day in which it cannot be further molested in that fashion. Unless they are being psychically probed, captive spirits are otherwise held in stasis in the same blank mindscape the spike imposes. One can be voluntarily released by extending the spike and spending one mote to force it out, emerging with the same traits as it entered with as modified by any additional psychic trauma inflicted upon it. There is no limit on the number of spirits that can be contained this way, but the death of the Alchemical also permanently kills all her captives.</p>

            <h4>Essence-Seeking Siphon</h4> (6xp):</span>
        <p>The Apostate may attach this voidtech submodule to Mind-Ripping Probe (see pp. 149-150), affixing a gruesome soulsteel barb to the tip of the interface stiletto. The base damage of the Personality Override Spike increases to +6L and even &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; insertion inflicts one level of lethal damage. Whenever the Charm&rsquo;s Essence drain feature is used, it transfers at a rate of 10 motes and still takes five motes if the victim spends Willpower to resist. The spirit absorption feature is also upgraded to permanently transform Autochthonian machine spirits it captures into gremlins as a Shaping effect, provided their will is already broken when the spike consumes them.</p>

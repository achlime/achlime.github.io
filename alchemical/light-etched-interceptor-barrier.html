        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm&rsquo;s outer appearance depends on the prerequisite upon which it builds. When attached to external plating, it takes the form of a bulky gauntlet around one of the Alchemical&rsquo;s wrists. For internal assemblies, a spiral pattern appears to have been seared into the back of the Exalt&rsquo;s arm, centering on an orichalcum nodule. In either case, the Charm hums and crackles upon activation, projecting a shaped potentiality field that appears as a slender wedge of radiance. When presented with an incoming hazard, this field telescopes open into a shield etched from solid light that provides a +3 DV cover bonus against all attacks without any associated fatigue or mobility penalties. Unexpected attacks bypass this protection. The active shield disrupts stealth like an anima banner at the eight- to 10-mote level.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="emergency-overcharger">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Emergency Overcharger</h4> (3xp):</span>
        <p>Whenever the shield applies its penalty to an attack that hits anyway, an Alchemical with this submodule may focus the Charm&rsquo;s power in Step Six to perfectly parry the attack. Doing so does not require a Charm activation, and even unblockable attacks may be stopped. Although the defense has no flaw of invulnerability, parrying an attack this way overloads the shield, involuntarily deactivating the Charm and preventing reactivation until the Exalt spends an hour recalibrating it as a diceless dramatic action. Essence 5+ Alchemicals may prevent overload by paying five motes per parry up to (Essence) times per scene, but they suffer the usual overload to parry afterward.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="essence-absorption-screen">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Essence Absorption Screen</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>If the shield is deployed against a damage source composed entirely of fire, lightning or other raw energy or Essence discharge of any type, the Alchemical also regains a number of motes equal to (his Essence x 2) or the raw damage of the attack, whichever is less. The effective raw damage of an attack that misses has zero attack successes applied to it. This absorption occurs whether or not the attack hits, as long as it garners at least one success to aim close enough to drain.</p>
<p>Any motes granted by the Essence Absorption Screen submodule must be added to the Alchemical&rsquo;s Overdrive pool as offensive motes. If he does not have an Overdrive pool, they are lost. Essence Absorption Screen only provides motes if the Alchemical is attacked against his will; he cannot gain Essence by deliberately harming himself or allowing an ally to do so. Weapons of solid Essence such as a <a class="complex" href="../solar/glorious-solar-saber.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Glorious Solar Saber'"><span class="link-focus">Glorious Solar Saber</span></a> or a beamklave are not affected by the defense of this Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Alchemical locks onto a single target she can currently perceive. Through the resonant Essence nodes of this Charm located on her wrists, she imprints an echo of that signature on a single projectile as she fires or throws it. The projectile dissolves into a harmless and intangible Essence bolt, passing through even dematerialized beings on the way to its target. This effect ignores all cover and may even be targeted through walls if the Exalt has some way to perceive a target on the other side. The projectile rematerializes just before striking, so armor affords its usual protection. Artifact weapons teleport back to the Alchemical if they miss.</p>

            <h4>Armor-Bypassing Algorithms</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>For an increased activation cost of two additional motes, the enhanced attack ignores non-magical armor and any artifact armor with a rating less than the Champion&rsquo;s Essence. Armor created by Charms, protocols and other magical powers whose creator has a lower Essence rating may also be ignored.</p>

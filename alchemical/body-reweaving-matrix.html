        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Hidden compartments scattered across the Alchemical&rsquo;s body hide colonies of thumbnail-sized automata shaped roughly like metallic spiders. When these bays are opened and fed a charge of Essence, the colonies awaken. Hundreds or even thousands of tiny machines swarm out across the Exalt&rsquo;s body, clustering around any wounds they find. The automata work quickly and tirelessly, spinning strands of unformed Essence that congeal into new matter. Where the spiders pass, they leave flesh and Charms restored to pristine condition.</p>
<p>While this Charm is active, the Exalt heals two levels of bashing damage per action tick. Once all bashing damage is mended, he regenerates a level of lethal damage each action tick instead. Amputated or destroyed limbs and organs may be reconstructed with this Charm, although doing so takes an hour per Crippling effect removed and prevents standard regeneration during this time. Amputated Charms and limbs disintegrate as the Body-Reweaving Matrix replaces them. This Charm may be activated while unconscious or otherwise inactive.</p>

        <p>The Charm can repair other living beings, magitech automata and inanimate objects as an alternative to healing the Champion, though this can only repair damage and cannot reconstruct amputated organs. Every hour of total concentration and unbroken physical contact with the subject heals one level of bashing or lethal damage. Patients do not bleed or continue to die if mortally wounded while undergoing treatment.</p>

        <p>The Charm can also remove unwanted Shaping effects and mutations imposed by such effects as if they were a form of amputation. Gremlin Syndrome cannot be cured this way.</p>

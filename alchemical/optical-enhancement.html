        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A wide array of ocular implants and enhancements have been developed over the centuries, of which the following upgrades constitute only a small sampling. Purchase of this Charm grants 12 experience points worth of submodules whose trait requirements the Champion meets. Others may be acquired normally.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="tactical-analysis-engrams">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Tactical Analysis Engrams</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Wits 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical&rsquo;s Optical Enhancement allows him to discern the Archery, Martial Arts, Melee, and Thrown ratings of any character that he can perceive, calling up a visual read-out displaying a relative assessment of their combat capabilities. He also learns any specialties that they have in those Abilities. A second purchase of this submodule adds War to the list of Abilities the Alchemical can detect, and reveals the Drill, Endurance, Might, and Morale of any unit he can perceive in mass combat.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="void-sight">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Void Sight</h4> (<span class="condition">Permanent Gremlin Syndrome</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>This voidtech submodule upgrades Optical Enhancement (see pp. 158-160). The Alchemical can actually see the smoky, cancerous stains of befouled Autochthonian Essence within (Perception) yards, allowing a difficulty 4 (Perception + Awareness) miscellaneous action to know whether a perceived target is a creature of the Void and its total Dissonance rating, if it has one.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="flash-shutters">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Flash Shutters</h4> (2xp):</span>
        <p>Translucent lids deploy when the Exalt is exposed to visual overstimulation, blocking the effect. This effect can also protect the Exalt&rsquo;s eyes from other blinding sources such as <a class="complex unresolved" title="Unresolved text body link"><span class="link-focus">Blinding Spark Distraction</span></a> (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Dragon-Blooded</strong>, pp. 155–156) at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="cross-phase-scanner">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Cross-Phase Scanner</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>The Exalt can see immaterial beings in Autochthonia as though they were manifested, as well as perceiving them with any senses for which he has Secondary Sensory Upgrades installed. By reflexively committing three motes for a scene as an innate power, he also extends these benefits to all allies within (Essence x 20) yards. A second purchase of this submodule improves it to function in other realms of existence.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="light-intensification-filters">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Light-Intensification Filters</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>Prosthetic chrome eyes allow the Exalt to see clearly in extreme low-light conditions, negating all penalties for anything less than absolute darkness. Bright light, however, subjects the character to a one-die internal penalty unless he has flash shutters installed.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="ultraperipheral-awareness">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Ultraperipheral Awareness</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>A cluster of jeweled receptors is set in an arc around the Alchemical&rsquo;s head, affording him 360-degree vision. If he is completely surrounded by opponents, the Exalt remains able to apply his DV against all of them.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="microscopic-lens">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Microscopic Lens</h4> (6xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical&rsquo;s eyes can focus on small objects and magnify them, granting two automatic successes on Perception rolls to examine details about specific objects and structures. The Storyteller should also supply appropriate magnified details when narrating sensory information.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="telescopic-lens">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Telescopic Lens</h4> (6xp):</span>
        <p>The Exalt gains the ability to clearly focus on objects up to a mile away, taking no penalties for doing so. This submodule does not increase the absolute effective range of ranged weapons, but it enables the Exalt to fire them accurately at targets within their upper range limits without any range penalties.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="diagnostic-overlay">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Diagnostic Overlay</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Intelligence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The Exalt can examine the biology and health of a target patient he can see, performing a diagnosis in a glance spanning a single miscellaneous action instead of needing five minutes of poking and prodding.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="motion-tracking-targeting-glance">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Motion-Tracking Targeting Glance</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Dexterity 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>To the Alchemical&rsquo;s eye, a glowing geometric symbol appears as a halo around those whom she locks onto with an Aim action in battle. This effect changes the bonus for aiming from dice to successes and cancels penalties for making called shots whenever launching a surprise attack and/or an attack benefiting from aim successes. A second installation of this submodule extends called shot penalty negation to all attacks.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="thermal-vision">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Thermal Vision</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Faintly luminous ruby lenses fitted in the Exalt&rsquo;s eye sockets allow him to see heat in place of conventional light, sliding over his eyes like a second eyelid when needed. Switching between normal and thermographic vision is a reflexive action that the Exalt can perform once per action tick. All heat sources appear to glow while in this vision mode, so warm-blooded creatures stand out against cooler backgrounds, but being within (Perception) yards of a powerful radiant heat source at least as hot as a fire blinds an Exalt using thermal vision unless he has flash shutters. The Alchemical cannot see conventional light while using thermographic mode, so he cannot perceive visual data based on color, pigment contrast (i.e., differentiating between shades of the same color) or brightness. This mode also applies a two-die external penalty to the difficulty of all rolls to notice or physically attack anything that is very close in temperature to its surroundings. Storytellers should assess Perception bonuses and penalties to this vision mode at their discretion, taking care to reward creativity on the part of both the Alchemical and his opponents.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="soulgem-transponder-overlay">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Soulgem Transponder Overlay</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Perception 4</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Soulgems attached to living beings or holding a soul light up within a frame of bright, multicolored geometric symbols when viewed by a Champion with this submodule. The palette and orientation of these symbols makes soulgems within (Perception x 10) yards automatically visible to the Exalt&rsquo;s senses, allowing him to perfectly negate all mundane Stealth actions taken by beings with the devices installed. Charm-assisted stealth of any kind renders a character&rsquo;s gem undetectable, as does the (highly illegal) practice of capping soulgems with lead. Absent such shielding, the Exalt ignores intervening matter to see the precise distance and vector to each soulgem in front of him (or all around, with Ultraperipheral Awareness). Once per action tick, he may reflexively analyze a soulgem he can perceive in order to learn its geometric configuration and associated social rank, as well as whether that artifact is presently installed in a living being or housing a disembodied soul.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="essence-sight-oculars">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Essence Sight Oculars</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Perception 5</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>An Alchemical with this submodule may reflexively pay one Willpower and commit (10 – Essence) motes to open her eyes to the higher-order truths of the universe for an hour. Using this power causes her eyes to glow brightly in the colors of her anima, inhibiting concealment like a four- to seven-mote Solar anima flare. The implanted adamant lens reveals the glorious symbols and interwoven patterns by which the Great Maker understands and categorizes the universe. Much of this data is incomprehensible to minds so much less advanced than the Primordial&rsquo;s. The small fragment of useful information gleaned duplicates the effects of <a class="complex" href="../solar/all-encompassing-sorcerers-sight.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight'"><span class="link-focus">All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 222), but the roll to analyze magic uses ([the Alchemical&rsquo;s lowest-rated Mental Attribute] + [lesser of Awareness or Occult]) as its dice pool. A second installation of this submodule downgrades the associated telltale eye glow to the equivalent of a one- to three-mote Solar anima flare.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="mass-penetrating-scan">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Mass-Penetrating Scan</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Perception 5</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>By reflexively spending one mote, the Exalt may selectively see through solid matter until his next action. This vision can penetrate up to (Essence) yards of solid obstructions at full power, but it can also be reflexively adjusted to lower settings. The Alchemical can see into a person&rsquo;s pocket, observe the individual&rsquo;s skeletal structure or peer all the way through the person and the wall behind him with equal ease. This submodule cannot see through the magical materials unless the Alchemical has Essence 5+, and wards against scrying block this vision regardless of Essence rating.</p>

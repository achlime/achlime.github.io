        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A complex assembly of alloyed magical material matching the Champion&rsquo;s caste is woven across and throughout most of her body. When charged with Essence, it reconfigures itself in a clash of pivoting joints and clicking gears, taking on the form of an artifact-template stored within the Charm. This artifact is directly attached to the Alchemical&rsquo;s body—unless such attachment would obviate its primary use (such as thrown artifacts)—and is impossible to disarm without amputating appropriate portions of the Exalt. Ranged-attack artifacts such as gyroscopic chakrams may be automatically and reflexively drawn back to the Exalt through Elsewhere for one mote. The Transcendent Multimodal Artifact Matrix may take on the form of any artifact, with the following restrictions:</p>
<p>The artifact&rsquo;s template must be stored in the Charm. The artifact&rsquo;s rating may not be higher than the Alchemical&rsquo;s Essence rating. If the artifact can enjoy a magical material bonus, it must be formed of the Exalt&rsquo;s caste material. The artifact must be either mass-produced or an example of a wide selection of mechanically identical artifacts. (For example, while every daiklave is a unique and storied weapon, all daiklaves share identical base traits and are valid templates for this Charm.) Singular or near-singular artifacts such as the Daiklave of Conquest or Flying Silver Dream are not valid. The artifact must not require maintenance or a hearthstone to power it. The artifact must not be designed to consume itself upon use. Finally, the artifact may not be notably larger than the Alchemical.</p>
<p>This Charm&rsquo;s activation cost is the attunement cost of the desired artifact configuration, or one mote if the artifact does not require attunement. It begins with a single Artifact •• template of the Exalt&rsquo;s choosing. Additional templates are downloaded as submodules from the vats for a cost of three experience points per dot rating of the template.</p>

        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Clockwork Companion Template</h4> (3xp per dot):</span>
        <p>The Matrix may be loaded with the templates of a mechanical servant. The cost to deploy such a familiar is two motes per dot rating. Slain familiars are transported back to the Exalt through Elsewhere and prevent the Charm from being reactivated to spawn a familiar for 25 hours.</p>

        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>External Surge Connector</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Templates for artifacts that depend on hearthstones or equivalent power sources may be installed, though the character must supply this power by plugging in appropriate Essence sources once an artifact is deployed. Plugging in a power source uses the same action as drawing a weapon.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="magitech-advancement">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Magitech Advancement</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Templates for artifacts with a Repair rating may be installed, provided they do not have an artifact rating more than (the Alchemical&rsquo;s Essence – 1). If an integrated artifact falls so far behind on maintenance that it would be irreparably damaged, it remains at its current state without further deterioration but does not operate until fixed. Champions with <a class="complex" href="technomorphic-integration-engine.html#pattern-mending-integration" title="canonical entry of additional effect 'Pattern-Mending Integration'"><span class="link-focus">Pattern-Mending Integration</span></a> installed in a <a class="complex" href="technomorphic-integration-engine.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Technomorphic Integration Engine'"><span class="link-focus">Technomorphic Integration Engine</span></a> (see pp. 165-166) may use that submodule to repair integrated magitech. Essence 5+ Alchemicals may install miniaturized versions of artifacts normally larger than themselves, provided their function is not intrinsically dependent on their larger size (such as vehicles or warstriders). Miniaturized artifacts function normally, such as a cannon in the arm duplicating a light implosion bow or a storm hammer.</p>

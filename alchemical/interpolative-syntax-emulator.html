        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Artificial synapse webs installed in the Alchemical&rsquo;s brain allow him to render any form of communication into raw numeric data and reconfigure it to mesh with currently understood modes of expression. After spending at least an hour listening to or attempting to read an unfamiliar language, the Alchemical may learn to speak or read it himself, paying five motes to do so. He must pay for languages individually and pay separately for spoken and written fluency. When speaking a language provided by this Charm, the Exalt&rsquo;s accent is thick with distinctive inflections and idioms taken from Autochthonic, enough so that anyone listening can tell he is not a native speaker of his assumed tongue. This accent does not inhibit communication, however. Conferred aptitude remains as long as the Exalt leaves Essence committed to the language. Emulated languages may be permanently integrated with no training times, if desired, as a Training effect.</p>

        <p>The Exalt speaks with any accent he has overheard, allowing him to pass as a native speaker of that dialect.</p>

        <p>The Exalt doubles all social bonuses and penalties from Clarity while using the Charm to apply mathematical hyperfluency to his understanding of Autochthonic. He also receives benefits when dealing with mechanical entities for which Clarity provides an interaction bonus identical to the effects of <a class="complex" href="../solar/mastery-of-small-manners.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Mastery of Small Manners'"><span class="link-focus">Mastery of Small Manners</span></a> (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 239–240).</p>

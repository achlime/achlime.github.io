        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm takes the form of an adamant ring implanted around the Alchemical&rsquo;s soulgem, inscribed with hundreds of tiny Old Realm glyphs. When activated, the crystal rapidly spins in its socket and the runes inscribed along its rim light up in patterns consistent with the protocol being invoked. At the consummation of the casting, sparks jump from the ring into the Exalt&rsquo;s soulgem before discharging with a brilliant display of power. This Charm may never be removed once installed, but it does not function for characters infected with Gremlin Syndrome.</p>
<p>The character may take Weave Man-Machine Protocol actions, which are identical to Shape Terrestrial Circle Sorcery actions save that they invoke a Man-Machine protocol rather than a spell. For full details on protocol weaving, see Chapter Six. This Charm cannot be placed in an Array.</p>

            <h4>Weave-Shredding Paradox Engine</h4> (<span class="condition">Permanent Gremlin Syndrome</span>, 12xp):</span>
        <p>A Man-Machine Weaving Engine (see p. 170) perverted by this voidtech submodule reawakens in spite of its bearer&rsquo;s Dissonance, but no longer interfaces with the Design. Instead, the Charm allows the Apostate to learn and cast spells as if she knew the Charms Terrestrial Circle Sorcery and Shadowlands Circle Necromancy. Such spells cost 12 experience points apiece, but the Exalt can also permanently excise a known (and now useless) protocol from her mind in lieu of paying this experience. Spells may be learned as other Exalted learn them from texts or teachers. Alternatively, Apostates can study a blight zone to unlock the secrets of Autochthon&rsquo;s decay as though learning a spell from an actual mentor, in which case the player pays the cost at the beginning of training. The Storyteller chooses a spell that will support the Apostate&rsquo;s Motivation once training is complete. Destructive Motivations yield destructive spells, while a desire for power tends toward mental influence effects, and so on.</p>
<p>When casting a spell, the Man-Machine Weaving Engine reveals its desecration by growing jagged saw teeth along its inner ring. These blades grind against the Alchemical&rsquo;s indestructible soulgem with a shrieking whine, throwing a shower of sparks and smoke as it unleashes its magic. The effects of spells cast this way distort to reflect the aesthetics of Autochthon&rsquo;s decay, so Death of Obsidian Butterflies might hurl a shower of rusting, razor-edged cogs instead of the usual projectiles. The player may supply this distortion as a stunt. Otherwise, the Storyteller determines how the spell cosmetically warps. No distortion should extend to the point of altering the resolution of the spell&rsquo;s effects. While intact, the Seal of Eight Divinities prevents spells from having effects that extend from Autochthonia to other realms of existence and vice versa, rendering many summoning spells useless until that barrier falls.</p>
<p>Apostates who have defiled their Man-Machine Weaving Engine may also install this submodule into a God-Machine Weaving Engine (see p. 170), expanding their spellcasting options as though they knew the Charm Celestial Circle Sorcery or Labyrinth Circle Necromancy. The choice must be made at the time the submodule is purchased and forgoes the alternative path. The process of learning and casting second circle spells otherwise follows the same rules as the first circle.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This dreadful Charm consists of a set of retractable soulsteel hooks set into the fingertips, subdermally wired to its prerequisite. The hooks may be extended for use or retracted by &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; them as weapons without activating the Charm. When drawn, the hooks cease to be internal and have the traits of tiger claws with the Piercing tag. When Transcendent Brutality Programming is activated to enhance attacks made with its physical components, however, the hooks become terrible instruments of torture and will breaking. If the attack hits, the target loses one Willpower regardless of damage and suffers a cumulative -1 external penalty to her player&rsquo;s next roll for the character to regain Willpower from sleep. Once this penalty exceeds her dice pool, the player gets no roll for the character to recover Willpower at all. If the victim has no Willpower point for the Charm to drain, she temporarily loses a dot of Willpower instead (to a minimum of Willpower 1). Lost dots return at the rate of one per day of restful (i.e., non-penalized) sleep.</p>

            <h4>Confessional Scream Extractor</h4> (3xp):</span>
        <p>Whenever this Charm takes a dot of Willpower, the victim reveals an Intimacy of her choice to her torturer by screaming it in her native language. This is an unnatural Compulsion costing only one Willpower to resist, but this cost is generally moot given that she has no Willpower to spend. The victim may not choose to reveal an Intimacy she has previously revealed to the Alchemical this way unless she has no secret Intimacies left.</p>

        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Lingering Horror Scars</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>Targets who lose any dots of Willpower from this Charm automatically gain or reassert an Intimacy of fear and associated Compulsion as described in the Instructive Fear Resonator for Rogue Cell Isolation Protocols.</p>

            <h4>Torturer Satisfaction Engrams</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Whenever this Charm takes a dot of Willpower from a victim, the Alchemical regains one Willpower point or one spent Conviction channel, as desired. In addition, all time the Exalt spends actively and deliberately inflicting suffering to those who have broken the laws of the Great Maker is considered meditation for the purposes of Essence recovery. Apostates respire the screams and sublimated tears of those faithful to the Great Maker instead.</p>

            <h4>Taint-Imprinting Agony Inducers</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 5</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>This voidtech submodule makes Transcendent Brutality Programming (see p. 146) a weapon of conversion. If the Charm reduces a mortal to a single Willpower dot, that mortal gains temporary Gremlin Syndrome as a Shaping effect for a number of days equal to the Apostate&rsquo;s total Dissonance at the time of activation, as though the victim had Voidtech Charms installed. If the victim reaches Dissonance 10 during this time, the infection becomes permanent. An Essence 5+ Apostate can even apply these effects to an Essence user, provided the victim&rsquo;s will is already broken and her Essence is not higher than his own.</p>

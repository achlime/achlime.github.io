        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Autochthon is the Machine God, and the works of his materials are paradigmatically his body. This Charm takes the form of a complex engine mechanism built into the torso adjacent to the central Essence reservoir. It can be activated in one of two ways. For a cost of one mote, the Exalt can internalize an artifact he owns and is touching. The artifact in question can&rsquo;t be notably larger than the Exalt and must predominantly consist of the same magical material as the Alchemical&rsquo;s caste (or an artifact with no material-based permutations). Internalizing a device causes it to fold up with a distinctive whirring-clicking noise and slide into hidden compartments within the Exalt&rsquo;s body. This process bypasses conventional laws of conservation regarding mass and volume, such that each internalized artifact adds no more than a pound to overall weight.</p>
<p>While internalized, the artifact is as inaccessible and immune to the passage of time as if it were stored Elsewhere. Ending the one-mote commitment causes the artifact to emerge from the body unattuned, but unlike most Charms, the act of releasing an artifact this way is not reflexive and instead requires a zero-mote activation of Technomorphic Integration Engine. The death of the Alchemical causes all internalized objects to emerge from the smoking carcass.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Alchemical may activate this Charm by paying the standard mote cost to attune an internalized artifact (such as five motes for a daiklave). In this case, the artifact unfolds out of the Exalt&rsquo;s body attuned and immediately available for use as the prior one-mote commitment lapses. Weapons unfolded to hand are drawn and otherwise readied as part of extruding them. Armor cannot be unfolded as immediate protection, but it may be donned normally. This Charm can&rsquo;t be swapped out while any objects remain internalized.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="precursor-technology-absorption">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Precursor Technology Absorption</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Wits 2</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical can internalize non-magical items of appropriate size and ownership as if they were valid artifacts for one mote each. No cost is required to attune them on extrusion, as this is not required to use such items. The death of the Exalt does not release such objects. Instead, they are destroyed. A second installation of this submodule reduces the cost to store mundane objects to zero motes, but the cost to activate Technomorphic Integration Engine to extrude them is one mote (uncommitted).</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="endodiagnostic-analytical-routines">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Endodiagnostic Analytical Routines</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Perception 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical perfectly understands all properties, powers and other characteristics of any object in the moment of internalizing it. This knowledge remains even after the item is extruded. Through comprehensive empathy algorithms that harmonize with new technology, the Exalt also can internalize objects that lack an owner (claiming instant ownership in the process). Finally, the cumulative difficulty to make a copy, improve a copy or make an improved version of any internalized object via appropriate Craft rolls is halved, rounded up. The example must remain internalized for the entire period of crafting for this benefit to apply.</p>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="pattern-mending-integration">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Pattern-Mending Integration</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Intelligence 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>The Exalt can perform maintenance or repairs on internalized items by meditating or sleeping instead of spending the same time on actual fixing tasks, with his player making any appropriate rolls for him to do so and requiring the usual trait minimums. Every hour of meditation/sleep counts as (Wits) hours of repairs. This unusual repair process does not require any other tools or expendable materials and restores Essence normally.</p>

            <h4>Instant Aegis Upgrade</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Stamina 5</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Artifact armor extruded in an attuned state grows into place for immediate protection, as long as the Exalt is not already wearing armor.</p>

            <h4>Resonance Harmonizer</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Each installation of this submodule decreases the commitment cost to extrude attuned artifacts with Technomorphic Integration Engine by one mote, to a minimum of one mote. The submodule can&rsquo;t be installed more times than the Alchemical&rsquo;s Essence rating.</p>

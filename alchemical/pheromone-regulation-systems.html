        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A set of micro-pumps and artificial glands implanted beneath the Exalt&rsquo;s skin allow her to synthesize and exude psychoactive biochemical fragrances that accentuate particular emotions. Any social attack the Alchemical makes against a target within (Appearance x 10) yards that is intended to induce a particular emotion or take advantage of the target&rsquo;s emotional state by inducing appropriate behavior costs an additional Willpower to resist. Such attacks are also unnatural mental influence against mortals. Examples include inducing lust and then seducing the target, or inducing rage and inciting violence. For the base effects of instilling a feeling, see the accompanying sidebar. Characters with this Charm installed are immune to all uses of it and treat activations as Obvious to their senses while in range of the chemicals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Alchemical may use this Charm to mask her own scent entirely. Doing so causes mundane attempts to track the Alchemical via scent to automatically fail and adds bonus dice equal to the character&rsquo;s Essence to the roll-off against contesting magic that depends on the Alchemical&rsquo;s scent.</p>

            <h4>Instinctual Aversion Formula</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>As desired, the Alchemical may exude chemical repellants. Natural animals in range experience a subliminal unnatural Compulsion to leave the radius of effect and not return for the rest of the scene unless they pay one Willpower to remain. Such beings will not generally resist without a very good instinct-driven reason, such as to protect their offspring or mates. Mortals are less affected, suffering a one-die internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions if they don&rsquo;t resist.</p>

        <p>The Exalt can distill a specific emotion into a single gelatinous pill as an alternative to normal activation. This pill emerges from a port just below the Exalt&rsquo;s stomach and retains its potency for one month. Anyone who consumes the capsule gets the benefit of the Charm as though she activated it but can only apply the one emotion. Alternatively, the Exalt can create a pill that makes the consumer vulnerable to all social attacks using the specific emotion as though in range of the Charm for the rest of the scene. These Poison effect pills cannot be tasted or smelled by human-range senses when dissolved into beverages. Doses do not stack in either case, and both types of pills are worth Resources ••• apiece.</p>

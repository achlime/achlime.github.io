            <p>Implants on the Champion&rsquo;s joints connect to his Accelerated Response System, allowing his body to take greater advantage of his boosted nervous system. This Charm has two modes of function, which may be employed simultaneously. Used as a one-action Charm, Celerity Enabling Module costs five motes and performs identically to Bulwark Stance (see Exalted, p. 193), save that it enhances only the DV types matching the character&rsquo;s current Accelerated Response System installations.</p>
<p>In its second mode, this Charm costs five motes and one Willpower and lasts for one scene. The character must select one opponent at the time of activation. She ignores all penalties to her DVs corresponding to current Accelerated Response System installations when defending against this opponent. This includes penalties due to her own actions. As always, DV inapplicability is not a penalty. Should the Alchemical wish to change designated opponents, she must terminate and re-invoke this Charm.</p>

        <p>The Alchemical can change designated opponents using the Charm&rsquo;s second mode without the reactivation counting as a Charm use. If the previous target is unconscious, dead or otherwise completely neutralized, or if the new target is a creature of the Void, the cost to shift targets is only five motes.</p>

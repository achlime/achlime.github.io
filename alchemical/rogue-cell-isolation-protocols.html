        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Inappropriate sentiment is disruptive to the routines of the Realm of Brass and Shadow. Lumpen should not be unduly pitied, heretics should not be coddled, and personal sentiments must never be placed above the well-being of god and state.</p>
<p>This Charm takes the form of a chrome and soulsteel plating surrounding each eye and extending just beyond the edges of their sockets. When charged with Essence, these hard and pitiless surfaces create a hall of mirrors effect in which the victim&rsquo;s reflection joins the flickers of tortured souls that seem to extend to infinity. This Charm may be used to supplement any social attack to erode an Intimacy, provided the Alchemical has a corresponding Augmentation installed for the Attribute used in the attack. If successful, the Intimacy is instantly erased and may not be reestablished for one day by any effect. No roll is necessary to target oneself: The unwanted Intimacy is simply excised, and the Alchemical gains a point of temporary Clarity.</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="entropic-psyche-scar">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Entropic Psyche Scar</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 4</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Successful use of Rogue Cell Isolation Protocols corrupted by this voidtech submodule allows the Apostate to redefine the emotional context of an Intimacy, rather than removing it. He can choose any context he desires, so long as the resultant Intimacy opposes either the social customs of the target&rsquo;s native culture or the dogma of the Great Maker.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="instructive-fear-resonator">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Instructive Fear Resonator</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 4</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>Whenever the Charm rips away an Intimacy, it also leaves behind or renews an Intimacy of fear toward the Alchemical. As an unnatural Compulsion, the victim cannot remove this Intimacy by spending scenes attempting to overcome his fear and must apply MDV and spend Willpower to resist all external influence that would cause him to lose it. Removing the Intimacy ends the Compulsion.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="emotional-irrelevance-systems">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Emotional Irrelevance Systems</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 5</span>, <span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>Characters who have lost an Intimacy from the Charm remain affected by a Compulsion requiring one Willpower to have their own actions in a given scene count toward rebuilding the Intimacy. The Compulsion ends once the Intimacy is rebuilt and does not affect others&rsquo; attempts to rebuild it through persuasion or other means.</p>

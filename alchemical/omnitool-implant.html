        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm fits into an Alchemical&rsquo;s hands. Upon activation, the character&rsquo;s hands dissolve into a churning of pulleys, gears, bars and bits to reconfigure themselves on the fly into any combination of tools desired. These utilities range from basic screwdrivers and hammers to advanced Essence calibration devices such as hyperion keys and valgrind couplers. The Alchemical suffers no penalties for crafting without tools and is considered to have access to a master&rsquo;s workshop (see <strong>The Books of Sorcery, Vol. III—Oadenol&rsquo;s Codex</strong>, p. 28). Attempts to use this Charm to produce weapons ons in combat can manage nothing better than improvised weapons (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 242) with Damage +0L and Defense +0. The Exalt&rsquo;s player may also enjoy a three-die situational bonus on rolls that could benefit from the use of precision tools, such as lockpicking.</p>

            <h4>Comprehensive Surgical Systems</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Intelligence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Taking the form of a set of bulky bracers built directly into the Exalt&rsquo;s arms, this submodule broadens the Omnitool Implant so that it can produce any surgical tool desired. While the submodule is active, the character takes no penalties for performing medical procedures without proper equipment. Moreover, he can perform surgery without inflicting more than a single level of lethal damage (regardless of the procedure&rsquo;s difficulty or other factors). He also halves the required time for all surgery, adds one automatic success to perform surgery and automatically succeeds on efforts to stanch a patient&rsquo;s bleeding or treat infected wounds (but not other forms of Sickness). A second installation requiring (Intelligence 4, Wits 3) allows him to perform medical treatment procedures that normally take up to an hour using a miscellaneous action. Such an action cannot be part of a flurry. A third installation at (Intelligence 5, Essence 3) allows a five-minute-long procedure to remove any Crippling injury less severe than true amputation. If an Exalt could ultimately heal the wound on her own given enough time, the Comprehensive Surgical Systems can rapidly sew and fuse the tissue together.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A lattice of sand-sized crystals studded through the Exalt&rsquo;s flesh gives her a slightly iridescent sheen when viewed under bright lighting. Charged with Essence, the lattice generates an optic camouflage. The Alchemical wavers like a heatmirage for a moment, then vanishes. As long as the Exalt makes no rapid or violent motion (physical attacks, Dash or Jump actions, etc.) and does not move more than one yard per tick, she remains invisible and impossible to detect via sight, regardless of acuity. Unless she speaks or otherwise gives herself away, attempts to locate her through mundane sound or smell are made with an external penalty of (higher of her Essence or Appearance). She can be detected by touch and taste normally. Characters with superhumanly acute hearing or sense of smell ignore this camouflage and may interact with the Exalt normally, as can characters with exotic senses that do not depend at all on sight (such as heat detection and echolocation) or some form of Essence sight.</p>
<p>Moving any faster than the permitted speed by means of personal locomotion does not end the Charm, but causes the Alchemical to appear as an Obvious rippling distortion in the air that is automatically visible. She fully vanishes again on the tick in which she next moves at an acceptable speed, though until she discreetly moves from that location, any attacks made against her by those who saw where she stopped ignore the Charm&rsquo;s protection. Traveling within a vehicle or by other external means does not disrupt the camouflage this way. Extremely rapid or violent movement (such as the activation of a <a class="complex" href="plasma-thruster-assembly.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Plasma Thruster Assembly'"><span class="link-focus">Plasma Thruster Assembly</span></a> or the initiation of an attack) terminates the Charm.</p>

            <h4>Dynamic Cloaking Module</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 1xp):</span>
        <p>Each installation of this submodule increases by one the maximum number of yards per tick the Champion can move without disrupting the camouflage. Once Dynamic Cloaking Module has been installed a sufficient number of times to cloak the Exalt&rsquo;s maximum dashing speed, it is not disrupted by any movement, even much faster methods available via Charms or other effects.</p>

        <p>With each installation of this submodule, the Alchemical may choose to immunize the Charm against being automatically bypassed by superhumanly acute hearing or smell. With both of these options integrated, a third installation covers all exotic senses and further renders the Champion as undetectable by these unusual senses as by normal vision.</p>

            <h4>Echo Chamber Vocalization</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Manipulation 2</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>This submodule distorts and displaces the sound of the Alchemical&rsquo;s voice, allowing him to speak while Optical Shroud is active without giving away his location.</p>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="essence-veil">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Essence Veil</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>With this submodule installed, the character is as invisible to Essence sight and comparable senses while cloaked as he is to normal vision.</p>

            <h4>Maximized Ambush Processor</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>Whenever an Alchemical cloaked by this Charm makes an unexpected physical attack, he counts attack successes twice for the purposes of determining damage (or triple, if making a close-combat attack). This attack deactivates the cloak normally.</p>

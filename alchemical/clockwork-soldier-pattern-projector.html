        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Gridwork patterns of Essence-conducting wire stretch across the surface of the Champion&rsquo;s face, linking his Tunnel- Fighting Tactical Omnibus Implant to his soulgem. When activated, this Charm radiates a pulse of Essence throughout a complementary unit in which the Alchemical is a special character, up to a Magnitude equal to his Essence rating. The pulse instills each soldier with an instinctive awareness of his commander&rsquo;s tactical prowess and unit&rsquo;s role in his plans. As long as the unit remains in close formation, it gets +3 Drill (even if this bonus temporarily raises Drill above 5).</p>

        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Veteran Faith Inculcator</h4> (3xp):</span>
        <p>At the end of each scene in which a unit enhanced by this Charm participated in actual mass combat against enemy forces, all unit members who survive the battle instantly develop or reassert an Intimacy of loyalty to whatever cause for which they were fighting. This includes the Alchemical. Deserters who broke from the unit are unaffected.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="populat-militia-drive">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Populat Militia Drive</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 4</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>If the unit is fighting within a city and the bulk of the unit members have lived in that city for at least one year, the unit gets +5 Drill instead and the unit commander adds the Champion&rsquo;s (Essence ÷ 2, rounded up) in bonus dice to all rally attempts.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="precision-tuned-coordinator">

            <h4>Precision-Tuned Coordinator</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Charisma 7</span>, 4xp):</span>
        <p>While a unit enhanced by this Charm is engaged with an enemy unit, the enemy commander must pay one Willpower to issue an order to change formation, as the Champion&rsquo;s unit moves to counter such tactical adjustments. A second installation also requires this surcharge from enemy commanders when attempting to disengage their forces from the Alchemical&rsquo;s soldiers.</p>

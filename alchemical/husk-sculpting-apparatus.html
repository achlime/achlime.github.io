        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm takes the form of hundreds of tiny wire hooks linking pistons to key points under the Exalt&rsquo;s skin, as well as a bank of Essence-fueled pigment injectors. Upon activation, the Alchemical recalibrates his physical appearance as an extremely rapid disguise action, substituting Appearance for Intelligence without the need for props or prior study of the target beyond a moment&rsquo;s observation. For its duration, the Charm changes the Champion&rsquo;s body instead of merely hiding its true appearance, allowing instant alterations to sex (including hermaphroditic or asexual, the latter of which provides a +3 MDV bonus against all seduction-based mental influence), overall physique, build, race, voice modulation and pigmentation (including introducing inhuman hues and adding or removing tattoos and scars).</p>
<p>The Exalt cannot modify his new body&rsquo;s final height or weight by more than 10 percent of its unmodified measurements. Virtually any body that a human being could have is fair game for the Charm, even body types that are crippled, deformed, unhealthy or otherwise damaged. Disguising oneself as a character with a lower or higher Appearance rating does not adjust the operation or effectiveness of Charms based on that Attribute, though it affects reactions normally (such as social combat modifiers). Use of this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite is still necessary to avoid having visibly implanted Charms spoil the disguise. Generally speaking, the changes wrought by the Charm result in a difficulty 1 for the disguise roll or 2 if attempting to copy a specific person.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a disguise created by Husk-Sculpting Apparatus is based on the threshold generated by the roll as normal, but the Charm is imperfect. Witnesses with a (Perception + Awareness) total of 11+ or who have any superhumanly acute senses automatically recognize him as an imposter upon encountering him without need for a roll or suspicion. Although many animals have superhuman senses, few are intelligent enough or well trained enough to care about a disguise when determining how they react. The Charm is even weaker against Essence sight or comparable Charms, as witnesses with such powers automatically perceive the Alchemical&rsquo;s true form overlaid on the disguise. Of course, failure to use Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier to hide all Charms when disguised as anything other than another Alchemical also spoils the ruse. Once the Charm deactivates, the Alchemical&rsquo;s body resets to its true form.</p>

            <h4>Self-Sculpt</h4> (3xp):</span>
        <p>The Alchemical can pay four extra Willpower when activating the Charm to disguise himself as himself, save for whatever modifications he wishes to apply. He can, for example, become himself but female or himself but skinnier, yet he cannot use that activation of the Charm to assist in impersonating someone else. As soon as the work is complete, the Charm deactivates and leaves behind the desired changes as permanent modifications to the character&rsquo;s body. The original unmodified shape of the character&rsquo;s body remains only as a notional concept to determine the validity of possible changes. As these changes are real, they do not alert appropriate senses that a disguise is being used, and they remain even if the Charm is uninstalled.</p>

        <p>Moonsilver microtech pigmentation further refines the visual details of the Exalt&rsquo;s disguise, preventing superhumanly acute vision from automatically piercing it. Mere sensory excellence is also not sufficient, so the static rating to recognize the Champion as an imposter similarly does not apply.</p>

        <p>A chrome rivet in the Exalt&rsquo;s throat with wires threaded through his voice box allows him to mimic any types of sounds he has heard before. While the Charm is active, his vocal precision blocks superhumanly acute hearing from automatically piercing its disguise. In addition, he can speak in the voice of anyone he has heard talk, replicate animal, machine or other inhuman noises, replay an eidetic auditory memory of any scene and perform other such feats of sonic puissance. With Essence 4+, he can issue booming vocal utterances like grinding metal that can be heard for a mile and deafen all mortals within (Appearance x 10) yards. Deafness induced this way wears off an hour after the listener last heard the sound.</p>

        <p>The Charm can no longer be automatically bypassed with Essence sight or comparable effects. It also provides three bonus dice for any roll-off against such Charms discerning its use or bypassing its function.</p>

        <p>Artificial distillation micropumps provide pheromones and other natural scents, blocking superhumanly acute smell or taste from automatically piercing the disguise. The character can instead choose to exude a pungent biochemical irritant, imposing a -1 internal penalty to all mortals and natural animals with a sense of smell within (Appearance) yards as an Obvious Poison effect.</p>

        <p>While Husk-Sculpting Apparatus is active, the character may continue to shift his body by reflexively paying an uncommitted cost of two motes per change, causing him to morph as though he had reactivated the Charm. These changes do not actually count as a Charm activation.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Coils of Essence-conducting wire entwine the Exalt&rsquo;s fingers on both hands, just beneath the skin. When fueled with Essence, the Charm becomes able to generate or dismiss a field of semi-palpable force visible as a faint distortion on the air. This field extends as a flexible ray with a maximum range of (Strength x 10) yards, congealing over any object it strikes as directed by the Alchemical&rsquo;s stylized gestures. While the Charm remains active, the beam can be retargeted as appropriate to actions using it.</p>
<p>This beam may be used to remotely manipulate inanimate objects with a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -1), substituting the Alchemical&rsquo;s Essence for Strength and Dexterity. It provides three automatic successes on all attempts to recall loose weapons or hurled projectiles, and may be used to make disarm attempts at range. The beam is also useful for various acrobatic feats, including swinging along ceilings from place to place, hanging suspended from a tether beam and even &ldquo;winching up&rdquo; the intangible grapple line. Other stunts may be possible at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>

            <h4>Recursive Force Suspension</h4> (3xp):</span>
        <p>By reflexively spending one mote, the Exalt may leave a held inanimate object to hover in place at its current location, enveloped in a corona of shimmering force. Suspended objects drop normally when the Charm ends or an external force moves them.</p>

            <h4>Cohesion Buffer</h4> (4xp):</span>
        <p>The beam now has a range increment of (Strength x 15) yards rather than a fixed range, penalizing actions past this distance normally.</p>

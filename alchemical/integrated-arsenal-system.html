        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A space-folding storage assembly is implemented into the Alchemical&rsquo;s arms (and possibly his legs, as well), allowing for nigh-unlimited weapon storage. At the time of purchase, this Charm grants the Champion two mundane close-range or projectile-launching weapons—so a crossbow or spear-thrower would be valid options, but throwing knives or chakrams would not. (This Charm does not provide ammunition for such weapons.) These weapons deploy in response to the Alchemical&rsquo;s will, unfolding from ports in his arms and hands to immediately spring to action, or disassembling and folding to unobtrusively disappear when violence is no longer deemed necessary. In effect, the Charm permits reflexive actions to draw or ready integrated weapons.</p>
<p>These weapons are physically attached to the Exalt&rsquo;s body and, as such, cannot be loaned to other characters. They also make it impossible to disarm the Exalt without an amputation effect. Amputated weapons may be replaced with an hour&rsquo;s work at the vats but otherwise require a week to regenerate on their own. Players and Storytellers are encouraged to adjust the appearance of weapons to reflect an industrial motif— wrist-mounted steel cable whips and whirling fist-mounted drills acting as khatars are entirely appropriate. Additional weapons may be purchased one at a time as submodules for one experience point each.</p>

            <p>The Champion&rsquo;s bones are plated in a magical material appropriate to his caste, with reinforcing wires and struts added to connect all of his major organs and muscle systems. The first time during a scene when the Alchemical suffers sufficient damage to reduce him to Incapacitated or below, this emergency reinforcement system makes it so that he is only reduced to (or remains at) his last -4 health level instead. As it takes time for the system to recalibrate itself after suffering such a violent shock, any further damage within the scene incapacitates the Exalt as normal.</p>

            <h4>Tireless Pneumatic Musculature</h4> (<span class="minimum minimum--trait">Essence 3</span>, 6xp):</span>
        <p>In addition to its base effects, the Charm also provides immunity to fatigue from strenuous exertion or wearing armor. This immunity does not remove the need for sleep and is temporarily disabled after the Exalt has gone more than 25 hours without a full night of sleep (or equivalent unconscious rest). Sufficient sleep recharges the immunity.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It is within the skill of the Solar Exalted to sear the souls of their lessers with a taste of true power. Those so enlightened are rarely ever the same again. This Charm supplements all Martial Arts attacks the Solar makes while it is active. On a successful strike, the character&rsquo;s anima irradiates the target, suffusing her Essence pathways with a constricting flow of overwhelming Solar Essence. Every time the target is struck with this Charm, the activation cost of her next Charm rises by two motes to a maximum surcharge of the Solar&rsquo;s Essence rating. In addition, the next Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability that the target wishes to activate costs an additional one Willpower. If two or more Solars strike the same target with Sun-Suffusing Slag, the mote surcharge on her Charms may only be increased to the rating of the highest-Essence Solar to strike her; individual lower-Essence Solars may not exceed their own Essence maximums for the purpose of stacking this surcharge. Furthermore, the Willpower surcharge to Charms possessing a Flaw of Invulnerability incurred by this Charm is never stackable. Exalts other than Solar Exalted who are continually struck with Sun- Suffusing Slag begin to exhibit Solar anima bleeding through their own anima displays as they continue to expend Essence in order to expel the Solar&rsquo;s irradiating influence.</p>

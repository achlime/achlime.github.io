            <p>A Solar need only will himself to move with speed beyond all reckoning. This Charm allows the character to cross extreme distances with a normal Move action. Upon activating this Charm the Solar may travel up to (Essence x 10) yards for three motes, (Essence x 20) yards for four motes, (Essence x 40) yards for five motes, (Essence x 60) yards for six motes, (Essence x 100) yards for seven motes, and up to one mile by paying eight motes and one Willpower. When using this Charm the Exalt is seen to flash from location to location instantaneously. This is not teleportation—the Solar must actually cross the intervening distance. Should the Lawgiver encounter a barrier that impedes his progress prematurely, he is refunded Essence and Willpower as appropriate to the distance already traveled—for example, if an Essence 5 Solar paid seven motes to traverse a 300 yard long canyon instantly, but discovered a wall of invisible force blocking him after only 80 yards, he would be refunded three motes. This Charm may be activated no more than once per action.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Death Draws Near. (Prerequisite: <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/shadow-races-the-light.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Shadow Races the Light'"><span class="link-focus">Shadow Races the Light</span></a>). This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

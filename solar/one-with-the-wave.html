        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In a moment of pristine stillness, the Solar&rsquo;s inner eye opens. Caught between calm and storm, she becomes the channel through which all forces flow, and that which would tear her asunder is cast aside. When the character is struck by a closerange attack, she may activate this Charm to make an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack against her opponent—specifically, a clinch attempt. If successful, the Lawgiver melds the course of her opponent&rsquo;s attack into a throw to the ground or a solid surface within up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards, inflicting the presoak damage of the attack which triggered this Charm upon the unlucky opponent.</p>
<p>Alternately, the Lawgiver may choose to hurl her victim at another foe within range of the throw. This is modeled as a second (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack with a base damage equal to the raw damage of the attack which triggered One With the Wave.</p>
<p>At Essence 4+, the Solar may use One With the Wave to respond to successful ranged attacks using physical projectiles. In this case she appears to be scathed by the missile, curling along the angle of the shot to pluck it from the air and whip it back at her opponent. This (Dexterity + Martial Arts) counterattack has a range of the Solar&rsquo;s line of sight and a base damage equal to the attack&rsquo;s raw damage against her. At Essence 5+, the Solar may use One With the Wave to answer energy-based attacks, channeling them directly through her body and back at her enemies.</p>

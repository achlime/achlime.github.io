            <p>Creation reverbs with the perfected performances of the Solars. With a closing flourish, the Solar&rsquo;s Essence renders his performance imperishable. As long as Phantom-Conjuring Performance was used in the performance this Charm may enchant anything from a short poetry reading, to a six-hours dance accompanied by an orchestra.</p>
<p>While Essence remains committed to the Charm, shimmering echoes of the performance will remain at the location. Anyone that happens upon the location is subjected to the performance attack as it was performed originally. The echoes can only affect a character once, encountering the echo a second time has no effect. Furthermore, if the original performance ran for a longer duration, nothing prevents characters from leaving before the echo concludes unless they are compelled to stay.</p>
<p>At Essence 5+ this Charm allows a surcharge of 3m and 1wp to allow the performance echo to affect the same characters more than once, but it will be limited to affecting the original targets only.</p>

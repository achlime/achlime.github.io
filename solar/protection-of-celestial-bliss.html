        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lawgivers have returned into a world of peril and sorrow, a cruel age that threatens to destroy all that they cherish and hold dear. Sol long as there is a weapon in their hands, they can fight against this dark time, holding it forevermore at bay. As the Solar activates this Charm, he attunes his martial instincts to a single Melee weapon he wields, invoking an auror of blue and gold flames to surround it with protective Essence. He takes no DV penalties from attacks made with the chosen weapon and adds +2 to its Defence rating.</p>
<p>The Solar may also use the enchanted weapon to perfectly parry any attack against him in Step 2, even if that attack is unblockable. Doing so ends this Charm prematurely, as the corona of protective Essence flares to supernova brilliance, and then fades away. Once the Solar has done so, he cannot reactivate this Charm for the rest of the scene, a limitation that counts as this defence&rsquo;s Flaw of Invulnerability.</p>
<p>With Melee 5+, Essence 5+, the Solar may invoke this defence up to (Essence / 2) times in one scene before this Charm ends.</p>

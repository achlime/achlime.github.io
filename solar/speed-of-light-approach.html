        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A Solar who dedicates herself to the principles of speed is as omnipresent as sunlight, and just as impossible to grasp. All of the character&rsquo;s movement rates are doubled, as long as she is moving under her own power. More importantly, whenever the character takes a Move, Dash or Jump action, she vanishes into a blur, only to reappear at her destination. The Lawgiver is impossible to target while moving, unless the attacker succeeds on a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll against a Difficulty of (Solar&rsquo;s Dexterity). The Solar may be targeted normally during any tick on which she takes an action other than to Move, Dash or Jump.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm at Athletics 7+, Essence 7+ triples the character&rsquo;s movement rates and causes any Move, Dash or Jump action she takes to count as an opportunity to re-establish surprise.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Swifter Than a Scream (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="godspeed-steps.html" title="mirror entry of charm 'Godspeed Steps'"><span class="link-focus">Death Draws Near</span></a>). This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

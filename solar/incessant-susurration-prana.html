            <p>The lawgivers can not be in all places at once. This charm allows them to bestow their innermost desires and ambitions on another in the form of ever-present whipsers of encouragement. When the Solar activates this charm her anima flares to the iconic level, with a single touch she mingles part of her essence with that of the target, bestowing upon him her most private ambitions and desires.</p>
<p>Only 5 motes of the initial 15 mote cost have to be committed. This charm can only be used on those that have an enlightened essence and on Exalts, and the Solar can sustain at most (Essence) concurrent activations of this charm. Due to the intimate mingling of essence, this charm creates a strong arcane link between the target and the Solar.</p>
<p>The target gains the motivation of the Solar as an intimacy. Furthermore, the target gains the Solar Whispers background at a rating of (Essence + Conviction) / 2. These Solar Whipsers manifest as a flood of whispers of encouragement and subtle guidance stemming from the subconscious of the Solar, and more often than not transfer not only the current ambitions of the Solar but her desires and some mannerisms as well.</p>
<p>As a background the Solar Whispers rating represents the attunement to the dreams and ambitions of the Solar. Characters can consciously tap into this connection once per scene by reflexively paying one Willpower point. Invoking this connection has several possible effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character can glean clues and other information from the subconscious of the Solar if his player succeeds at a (Perception + Solar Whispers) roll. More successes yield clearer and more extensive information. The effective number of successes may not exceed the character&rsquo;s Solar Whispers rating. Failure results in distorted or false information that leads characters astray.</li>
<li>A character&rsquo;s presence at significant events that further the agenda of the Solar my trigger a reflexive activation of Solar Whispers to understand the event. In particular, the first meaningful interaction between two characters with Solar Whispers (from the same Solar) often causes them to experience visions of each other.</li>
<li>A character can use the Solar Whispers as a guide to where the Solar believe his actions could further her goals. Depending on the ambitions and desires of the Solar this might entail large or small obstacles and tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these effects, players can pick one of the following effects when purchasing the charm:</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="guiding-caress">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Guiding Caress</h4> (2xp):</span>
        <p>the whispers are manifested not only in speech, but are augmented with emotions, smells and touch. The target has a -2 MDV with regard to social attacks by the Solar.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="essence-communion">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Essence Communion</h4> (2xp):</span>
        <p>the Solar can trigger a vision in which the Solar and the target can communicate and interact as if physically present in the same location. They both enter a comatose state as long as they are joined in the subconscious of the Solar. This effect costs 3 motes, 1 willpower to activate.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="voluntary-pupil-agreement">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Voluntary Pupil Agreement</h4> (2xp):</span>
        <p>when this charm is activated, the target can opt to commit 5 motes, freeing the Solar from this commitment. Should the target let his commitment lapse, the Solar can prevent deactivation of this charm by paying a surcharge of 5 motes, 1 willpower above the normal commitment charge of 5 motes.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="efficacious-encouragement">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Efficacious Encouragement</h4> (2xp):</span>
        <p>when invoking his connection to the Solar, for one roll, the target can substitute the Solar&rsquo;s Ability score for one of his Abilities.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>All limitations in existence shrink in the face of Solar determination. That which is impossible becomes merely difficult; that which is indestructible crumbles; that which cannot be slain lies dead upon the earth. When a Solar crashes against the boundaries of her own power, that limit also falters. All Charms within the Ability corresponding to this Charm reduce their minimum Ability and Essence ratings by one when the character attempts to learn them. All subsidiary powers contained within such Charms (such as the Archery 6+ damage upgrade of <a class="complex" href="lambent-bolt-of-annihilation.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Lambent Bolt of Annihilation'"><span class="link-focus">Lambent Bolt of Annihilation</span></a>) also lower their requisite Ability and Essence ratings by one. For example, if a character learned Divine Transcendence of Linguistics, the Charm <a class="complex" href="beautiful-essence-born-rune.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Beautiful Essence-Born Rune'"><span class="link-focus">Beautiful Essence-Born Rune</span></a> would drop from minimums of Linguistics 6, Essence 6 to Linguistics 5, Essence 5. Under Divine Transcendence of Melee, all of the repurchase opportunities of <a class="complex" href="golden-destruction-cut.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Golden Destruction Cut'"><span class="link-focus">Golden Destruction Cut</span></a> would become available one dot earlier. Divine Transcendence of (Ability) cannot reduce the requirements of any Charm with minimums of (Ability) 10 or Essence 10. Charms retain their original ratings for all other purposes, such as building Combos. Upon achieving (Ability) 10, Essence 10, this Charm vanishes and the Solar is refunded its cost.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Apocalyptic Evolution of (Ability) (Prerequisites: None). This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart in all regards.</p>

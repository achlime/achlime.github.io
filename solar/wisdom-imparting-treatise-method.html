        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lawgiver passes on her holy insight. Perhaps by writing a detailed treatise on the topic, inventing a mantra that offers insight, or by writing a collection of poems that bring a dawning understanding to a pupil. Regardless of the linguistic format the Solar adopts, the work conveys a deeper understanding to the reader, even thought it is not necessarily recognizable as a training manual at first glance.</p>
<p>The training manual may contain up to (Linguistics) teachings. Each of these teachings focus on a specific trait that the Solar can teach through the use of Training charms. This Charm may explicitly be placed in a Combo with any Training-Keyword Charm from any Ability, even in violation of standard Combo rules, permitting those effects to be encoded into the resultant magical training manual. The activation costs of each training Charm need only be paid once, even if multiple teachings are drawn from that Charm.</p>
<p>The drafting and writing of a training manual is a time-consuming task, with each teaching requiring two weeks of full-time work. Due to the fact that the main effort of creating a training manual is not the actual writing, but the construction of the curriculum and deliberations on how to express the instructions in the first place, this Charm cannot be placed in a combo with Whirling Brush Method</p>
<p>Normal training charm limits are observed, tough the Solar may voluntarily lower the highest possible rating that can be learned from the manual.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Solar may also declare minimum ratings that a potential pupil must meet before being able to learn anything from the training manual. These minimum ratings may include traits that are not included as teachings. Regardless of whether the traits for these minimum ratings are included in the lessons, the Solar must satisfy the minimum requirements set forth.</p>
<p>Those who who study the teachings, satisfy the minimum requirements of the training manual, may increase those traits as though the Solar were tutoring them through the use of the releated training Charm. Only a single person may be the beneficiary of the training manual&rsquo;s insights at a time, though the manual retains its qualities over time as any written work would.</p>

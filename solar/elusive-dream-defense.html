            <p>Like a dream slipping form a waking man&rsquo;s graps, the Solar eludes others&rsquo; attempts to chain his mind. The Solar uses this Charm in response to an attempt at mental influence, be it natural or unnatural. In addition to its core effects, this Charm perfectly negates that attempt at influence.</p>
<p>This Charm defens the character against mental influence by forging an instant, sorcerously charged Intimacy (see boxed text) to an idea or ideal that protects him. For the purposes of this Charm, this Intimacy might be enmity with the person attempting the influence, contempt for that person or loyalty to something that the influence would make him betray. This effect is optional if the character already has such an Intimacy. If he has a preexisting one that is applicable, the magic can bolster it to inviolability instead. Characters observing the Solar when this Charm is used can make a reflexive (Perception + Investigation) roll against a difficulty of the character&rsquo;s Temperance to notice the newborn or newly renewed enmity, loyalty or disdain. The Solar genuinly accepts the Intimacy to which he commits himself with this Charm, although the player decides how much weight he gives it compared to his other ideas, plans, loyaltes and goals. At the end of the story, the Essence charge dissipates from the Intimacy, and it is no longer a perfect defense, though the character may maintain it for later use, the sake of the memory or out of genuine feeling.</p>
<p>This Charm lists a duration of Instant (Story). This means that the motes are committed for the rest of the story.</p>

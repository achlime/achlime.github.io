            <p>The character steels herself for the struggl ahead. She awakens in her soul a deep and terrible passion—stoic dedication, primal rage, merciless justice or some other emotion appropriate to her nature—and lets it drive her into battle.</p>
<p>This Charm gives the character an extra die to all combat-related pools and reduces all wound penalties by one. The character must be engaged in combat or attempting to become so engaged. She can attack at range and differentiate friend from foe, but she cannot utter sentences of more than a few words, move away from the enemy or perform complex actions such as retrieving a small object from a pack. To end this Charm prematurely, her player must spend one Willpower.</p>

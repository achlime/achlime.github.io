        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar Exalted know how to influence the Essence flows around them. By engaging in congress with another for at least an hour they are able to balance the intricate patterns of Essence that flow through the bodies of both participants, and greatly increasing Essence respiration by focussing on the Gaian principles within creation.</p>
<p>Upon activation of this charm the Solar and her partner need to commit 3 motes of Essence to balance their unified Essence flow. The motes may be committed by either partner in any distribution, as long as 3 motes are committed. The Solar and her partner engage in consummate intimate activity, and although both the Solar and her partner count as engaged in strenuous activity for the duration of this charm, each partner has a natural Essence respiration rate of (5 + partner&rsquo;s Essence × 5). This enhanced respiration is treated as motes recovered by a charm (i.e. it can restore mote pools created by <a class="complex" href="immanent-solar-glory.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Immanent Solar Glory'"><span class="link-focus">Immanent Solar Glory</span></a> and other like effects).</p>
<p>Although this charm&rsquo;s describes a couple consisting of female and male, all gender configurations are valid.</p>

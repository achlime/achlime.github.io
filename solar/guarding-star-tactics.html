        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar Exalted embody a limitless destructive power which is second to none. Using this Charm, the character may tap into that power, focusing it into a large-scale defense capable of striking down and turning aside all oncoming forces with an even greater force of her own. Defending herself is not good enough; even if a star should fall, the Exalt may use Guarding Star Tactics to deflect it away from all that she wishes to protect by an unrivaled display of power. This Charm serves as a permanent upgrade to Heavenly Guardian Defense, allowing it to be activated with a four mote surcharge to serve as a perfect parry against any area-of-effect attack, environmental damage effect, or ranged attack from a complementary unit—a parry which destroys or turns aside the offending attack. Players should feel free to invent suitably dramatic stunts to express the way in which attacks are defeated.</p>
<p>Attacks may be divided into two categories: transitory and sustained.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transitory: Transitory attacks are attacks composed of non-imperishable physical matter, energy, or non-permanent environmental hazards. Defending against a transitory attack destroys that effect utterly at the point where it intersects the Lawgiver&rsquo;s weapon, preventing it from harming anything behind the Solar, or any complementary unit he is a special character in.</p>
<p>For example: The Exalt unleashes an arc of solar flame from his blade, burning away an arrow volley as it descends toward his army. Crackling waves of golden lightning erupt from the Solar&rsquo;s daiklave, shattering a swarm of obsidian butterflies in midair. The Solar&rsquo;s weapon strikes an incoming tidal wave, sending a sheet of Essence boiling across it surface and evaporating it before it can smash into Chiaroscuro. The Lawgiver&rsquo;s sword dissolves the leading edge of a Total Annihilation shockwave, unraveling the spell in moments. The Solar plunges his weapon into the ground, stilling an earthquake with a pulse of Essence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustained: Sustained attacks include attacks made of the five magical materials, attacks which are part of the body of a living being, permanent environmental hazards, and environmental hazards or attacks which the Storyteller deems unsuitable to arbitrary destruction. Attacks made with imperishable materials (such as a rain of jade arrows) are simply scattered and deflected without harm. Attacks made by permanent environmental hazards (such as the Pole of Fire) are stilled within (Essence) miles for (Essence) actions. Attacks made by living environmental hazards (such as the winds of Adorjan or a Lunar using a swarm Knack) are prevented from moving to intersect or bypass the position of Solar or any complementary unit he is a member of until their DV has refreshed. Attacks unsuitable for arbitrary destruction are generally one-of-a-kind storyline events, and are deflected or otherwise handled according to the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. Potential examples of resolution of such attacks:</p>
<p>Golden lightning leaps from the Solar&rsquo;s blade to catch Mount Metagalapa before it can fall on her army, then shifts the mountain so that it is deposited safely on the ground several miles away. A shockwave erupts from the Solar&rsquo;s blade, knocking the flying manse away without harm moments before it would have crashed into Tzatli. A pillar of sunfire rises from the Lawgiver&rsquo;s blade, preventing two of Malfeas&rsquo;s layers from crashing together and sending them slowly drifting apart. A slash releases a cyclone which ironically carries Adorjan away.</p>

</ul>

            <p>To the Lawgivers, no number of concurrent appointments is too many. Even being in two places across creation is not impossible for the Chosen of the Sun.</p>
<p>Activating this Charm, the Solar spends five minutes in deep meditation to shape an Essence-based mirage of himself. These mirages are semi-independent extension of the Solar&rsquo;s will. The mirages share his personality, goals, traits and essentially operates as him. They do not consider themselves to be independent entities. The mirages are free to travel away from the Solar, and will persist as long as the motes remain committed.</p>
<p>The mirage does not need food, air or sleep, but can act is if it does. The mirage gets 2 automatic successes on rolls to act as if it is a normal living being. Anyone interacting with the mirage must succeed at a difficulty 4 (Perception + Awareness) roll to realize that this is not the actual Solar. Even if they succeed they find it difficult to point out exactly what is off.</p>
<p>The Solar is not aware the memories and experiences of the mirage. In order to absorb the memories of anything learned by a mirage, the Solar must touch the mirage and spend a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -0) re-absorbing it. If a mirage is destroyed, or if the committed motes are cancelled, the memories are irretrievably lost.</p>

            <p>Solar Exalted imbue their warriors with something of their own nature. This Charm enhances the Exalt&rsquo;s ability to train warriors. This Charm allows him to use Tiger Warrior Training Technique to train others in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Military Abilities he possesses at 4 or more. In addition to the abilities already available through Tiger
  Warrior Training Technique, military Abilities include Thrown, War, Integrity, Resistance, Survival, relevant Craft, Medicine, Athletics, Awareness, Stealth, Ride and Sail.</li>
<li>Willpower. The Exalt can train Willpower to a maximum of 7.</li>
<li>Bonus dice. The Solar can devote one week&rsquo;s training to rare and special techniques. This gives trained characters two bonus dice or one bonus success for a specific activity defined by the Solar during training. This benefit must have military relevance, it does not apply to Exalted targets, and it is not cumulative. Characters must abandon their previous training and lose the previous bonus to benefit from this Charm again. This bonus can apply to rolls for any Ability and is considered an artificial two-die specialty that stack with (at most) one die of other specialities. Examples include a one-success bonus in silent communication, a two-die bonus in fighting when outnumbered and a two-die bonus for nocturnal fighting. Non-extras must pay four bonus points or eight experience points for this benefit, and they gi into experience debt as usual if they cannot pay. The Storyteller is the final authority on whether a special technique has military relevance.</li>
</ul>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Capable of mastering all forms of combat, a Solar need not limit herself to a single weapon. This Charm represents the Lawgiver&rsquo;s mastery of and kinship with all forms of tactile artifact weaponry. When attuning multiple artifact weapons, the Solar commits Essence to the weapon with the highest attunement cost. All additional artifact weapons cost only a single mote to attune. The Solar may attune artifacts up to double the mote cost of the initial attunement. For example, she pays an attunement cost of five motes to attune a daiklave, and may now attune five additional weapons, each for a single mote, provided each weapon has a commitment cost equal to or less than five motes. If she attempts to add a weapon to her array which has a higher commitment cost than the most expensive of her current weapons, the original highest-cost weapon in her current panoply of attuned weapons transfers all but one mote to the new highest-cost weapon and the Solar attunes the new weapon by paying the difference.</p>
<p>The Lawgiver may expressly use this Charm to reduce the attunement cost of artifact weapons for use with combat abilities other than Melee, however it does not reduce the cost to attune armor, N/A-rated artifacts or non-weapon artifacts.</p>
<p>At Essence 4+, once the Solar has attuned enough weapons to double the commitment cost of the highest-cost weapon in her array, all additional artifact weapons have an attunement cost of zero motes. At Essence 5+, the power of her attunement expands further: the Lawgiver may reach the threshold of zero mote attunement after increasing her total commitment by only 50%, rounded up. For example, at Essence 5+ the Solar attunes a daiklave for five motes. The next three weapons she attunes will each cost a single mote, and all weapons beyond that will cost zero motes.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Blades Well-Blooded (Prerequisites: None). This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart, permitting Abyssals to easily carry the tools of their grim trade forth into Creation.</p>

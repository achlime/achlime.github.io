        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Master archers have been known to snuff out candles with a shot from their bow. But the skill of the Lawgivers is such as to smother bonfires with a single arrow. This Charm has two uses. The one mote version enhances an Archery attack, preventing any peripheral motes spent on the attack from adding to the character&rsquo;s anima banner. In addition, if the attack does health levels of damage to the target, that target&rsquo;s anima display rises by a number of motes commensurate to the peripheral motes spent on the attack. Because the Solar is shooting out her own anima, this Charm expressly allows her to tag non-Exalted opponents with anima displays. All targets struck with Flashing Sunspot Attack suffer the same Stealth deficiencies as characters flaring their anima banners (see Exalted, p. 114).</p>
<p>The second use of this Charm folds into the first use: the character may spend one mote to activate this Charm. However, instead of attacking a particular opponent, she may fire her anima into the scenery in an attempt to uncover hidden opponents. As above, any additional peripheral motes she spends on this activation are voided. Upon making this shot, her current anima display automatically drops down a level. Where her arrow lands, it creates a heatless bonfire of Solar anima 50 yards in diameter, breaking all concealment magic in the area and making stealth in the vicinity of the flare impossible. A Solar in the 8-10 range of anima display may choose instead to pay two motes to make this shot, dropping her down two full levels and creating a bonfire 100 yards in diameter. By paying a third mote, the Solar can void an 11-15 mote display, creating a bonfire 200 yards in diameter. Characters who use this Charm to drop their anima into the 1-3 range are considered to have spent only a single mote of peripheral Essence for the purposes of rebuilding their anima banner.</p>
<p>At Essence 4+, the Solar may use the one mote version of this Charm to move bonfires she has created by shooting through them. The blaze is snuffed out by the arrow&rsquo;s passage, and reappears wherever the arrow lands. At Essence 5+, this Charm reveals the presence of dematerialized spirits and demons within the area of the bonfire. In addition, the Lawgiver may shoot out the anima of other characters, using the same mote costs to downgrade their anima as she would to void her own display. In this instance, the Lawgiver&rsquo;s shot need not hit the character in question; merely passing close by is enough to puff out someone&rsquo;s Essence candle. Her arrow snuffs her target&rsquo;s anima display and deposits it wherever the shot lands, creating a bonfire as if she were shooting out her own anima.</p>
<p>Characters wishing to defend against having their anima snuffed may cut the arrow from its course with a successful parry, or may move their anima from its course through a successful dodge. If either their parry or their dodge fails, they do not take damage, but the arrow succeeds in stripping their anima and embedding it elsewhere in the scenery. This use of Flashing Sunspot Attack does not allow the Solar to downgrade her own anima, choosing instead to snuff out someone else&rsquo;s, but may allow her to exploit an opponent&rsquo;s flaring anima to reveal a retinue of guardian demons or a Throne Shadow assassin nearby. Bonfires created by this Charm last the entire scene before guttering out.</p>

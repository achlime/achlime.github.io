        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The greatest among the Exalted find it no great feat to master the arts of their subordinates. The experience cost of Terrestrial Martial Arts Charms is reduced to 4xp, or 5xp if Martial Arts is not a Caste or Favored Ability (or if the character has no Favored Abilities, as in the case of Alchemicals), and their training time is halved. During character creation, Terrestrial Martial Arts Charms cost half as much as native Charms, meaning that each starting Charm (or Charm purchased with bonus points) allocated to such a style provides two Charms instead. As a final benefit, the character no longer needs to pay a surcharge when using elementally aspected Terrestrial Martial Arts styles. Should a character who already knows Terrestrial Martial Arts learn this Charm, the experience cost of those Charms is retroactively lowered and the character is refunded the difference.</p>
<p>This is a stand-alone Celestial Martial Arts Charm, which may only be learned by Celestial Exalted and akuma. Non-Solar Exalted know the Charm by different names; Abyssals call it Blood-Soaked Lotus Roots, while the Green Sun Princes know it as Roots of the Brass Lotus and Sidereals have dubbed it Perfected Lotus Mastery. Lunar Exalted know the Charm as Terrestrial Bloodline Integration.</p>
<p>Alchemical Exalted achieve an identical effect through the use of a <a class="complex" href="../alchemical/perfected-lotus-matrix.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Perfected Lotus Matrix'"><span class="link-focus">Perfected Lotus Matrix</span></a> submodule called <a class="complex" href="../alchemical/perfected-lotus-matrix.html#lotus-filament-conduction" title="canonical entry of additional effect 'Lotus Filament Conduction'"><span class="link-focus">Lotus Filament Conduction</span></a> (Essence 2; 6xp).</p>

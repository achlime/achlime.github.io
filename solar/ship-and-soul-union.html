        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The power of the Solar Exalted extends to all things which enable their legends. This truth is demonstrated clearly by this Charm, through which any ship the Solar commands becomes an extension of his anima. Upon first purchasing this Charm, the Solar&rsquo;s ship gains the effect corresponding to his caste. Additional powers may be purchased for two experience points each. The Solar&rsquo;s vessel may only benefit from one effect at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dawn: For three motes, the Solar&rsquo;s ship becomes an extension of his terrifying might for the rest of the scene—the minds of his opponents are clouded with fear at the thought of the reprisals that would be invited by assaulting such a vessel. Opponents must pay two points of Willpower to ignore this unnatural Compulsion if they wish to target the ship with their attacks. This power in no way prevents the ship&rsquo;s crew from being targeted.</li>
<li>Zenith: For three motes, the Solar&rsquo;s ship becomes Holy ground for the rest of the scene. Any creature of darkness boarding the vessel enters an environmental hazard with (Damage 2A/action), Trauma (Sail).</li>
<li>Twilight: The ship becomes aware of all threats approaching within (Essence x 30) yards, from above, below, or beside the ship; this warning is communicated to the Solar in the form of eerie sea-sounds which appraise him of the position and bearing of the threat (for example, something below the ship and approaching fast). This benefit costs one mote, and lasts for one day.</li>
<li>Night: For three motes, a mist rises up around the ship&rsquo;s shrouding it from view. This grants a +3 bonus to all Stealth attempts, and reduces the cost of Sea Ambush Technique by one point of Willpower.</li>
<li>Eclipse: The Solar may pay five motes to cause his anima to surmount the ship as a flag bearing complex sigils which may be understood by all observers. This flag may offer the terms of a truce, alliance, or financial arrangement. It is clear that this offer is genuine, and magically binding; should the captain of another vessel verbally agree to the terms offered by this flag, that fact becomes Obvious to the Solar and he may pay one Willpower to sanctify the oath as though with the Eclipse anima power. Additionally, if the character is a member of the Eclipse caste, he may sanctify any oath spoken aboard his ship that he is aware of for a cost of only one point of Willpower.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Sail 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm gains the Stackable Keyword, and the Solar may simultaneously apply up to (Essence – 4) different effects at a time.</p>

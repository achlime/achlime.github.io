        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a Lawgiver&rsquo;s vast strength at last reaches its limit and he falls in defense of Creation, the world itself may cry out for its savior to rise up and fight on.</p>
<p>This Charm automatically takes effect when the character&rsquo;s Incapacitated health box is marked off with lethal or aggravated damage, provided the Solar fell while attempting to defend or champion those weaker than himself, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. (As a general guideline, any situation where the Solar could reasonably have channeled his Compassion likely qualifies.) Subtle ribbons of golden Essence wind across the battlefield, trailing back to the masses on whose behalf the Lawgiver fought. If they believe in him, then he hears their prayers as his life bleeds away; if they spurn him despite his efforts, their deep need for a savior calls out to him regardless. One long tick after becoming Incapacitated, the Solar rises from the ground in a flare of sizzling Essence, iconic anima burning around him. Half of his health levels immediately restore themselves, along with half his total Essence and Willpower (assuming he fell with those pools reduced below the halfway point). At the end of the scene, his permanent Essence rating falls by one dot. This Charm may not be triggered more than once per season. Non-Solar Exalted may never learn this Charm.</p>

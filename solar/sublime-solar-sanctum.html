            <p>A manse is a powerful and versatile structure, but from time to time the Solars find such magical structures still not personal enough. When purchasing this Charm the Solar gains the ability to cap a demesne with nothing more than his Essence. The result is a very personal manse, including a heartstone the character can use as normal. The manse automatically becomes the character’s Residence for the purpose of Residence Charms.</p>
<p>To cap the demesne the Solar first spends 20 motes and 2 willpower. This expenditure starts the building of the manse. The Solar can walk around in the demesne, rest outside or within any part that is finished, but he cannot leave the site for a whole month. During this month, the 20 motes of Essence are committed to the project. The manse gains 5 additional creation points compared to the usual manse construction rules. The manse shapes according to the Solar’s soul. Whatever the Solar wishes comes to reality, creating a manse which is often a reflection of the Solar’s inner self. While skill in architecture is not required for using the Charm, those who possess such skills can often draw on inspiration outside their own experience and apply subtle details to the construction.</p>
<p>When the manse is finished, the committed motes are released and the manse is forever linked to the Solar. Should the Solar ever die, the manse disappears at the very same moment. The Solar may choose to use this Charm to cap a new demesne, but doing so causes the previous manse to disappear as well. Should the manse ever be destroyed by other means, the hearstone immediately shatters and the Solar suffers a number of health levels of aggravated damage equal to manse’s rating, which bypasses armor.</p>

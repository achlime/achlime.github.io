        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar Exalted wish their friends to be able to visit easily, while they&rsquo;d rather see their foes stay far away. This Charm is especially beneficial for Residences that are built away from civilization. The road that leads to the character’s front step becomes particularly easy to tread for his friends, while his foes will find the trip to be uncomfortably difficult.</p>
<p>Upon learning this Charm, the Solar declares a certain route through the wilderness the avenue to her residence. The avenue always runs from a single city, town or other stronghold of civilisation. It may be as long as is required, though it cannot run farther than needed to reach a point of civilisation in a certain direction. The Solar and her travelling companions can traverse the route with great speed. The travel speed on the avenue to or from the character’s Residence is multiplied by (Solar&rsquo;s Essence x 2). This goes for mundane travel as well as magical travel.</p>
<p>With the expenditure of 1 mote, the Solar can declare someone a friend, foe or neither at any time. By doing so she can not suddenly hide the avenue from those already on it, but it does remove the benefit of increased travel speeds. Those declared neither friend nor foe can find the avenue, but do not benefit from increased travel speeds in the same way the Solar or her friends do.</p>
<p>If the Solar knows <a class="complex" href="speed-the-wheels.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Speed the Wheels'"><span class="link-focus">Speed the Wheels</span></a>: The character’s friends can find the avenue without trouble and step onto it with great ease. Any character declared a friend can travel the avenue as if she is in the company of the Solar, increasing their speed by (Solar&rsquo;s Essence x 2).</p>
<p>If the Solar knows <a class="complex" href="indolent-official-charm.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Indolent Official Charm'"><span class="link-focus">Indolent Official Charm</span></a>: For the character&rsquo;s foes the avenue completely vanishes. Her foes can still travel towards the Residence but the way does not automatically become clear. Any roll her foes have to make to locate the Residence suffers an external penalty equal to the Exalt&rsquo;s Essence. Furthermore, the foes&rsquo; travel time is multiplied by the character&rsquo;s Essence when attempting to travel to the residence. These penalties apply to all travel towards the Residence, not just the direction of the avenue, though it only goes for the last leg in a journey.</p>

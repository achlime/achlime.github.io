        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Learning this Charm permits the Lawgiver to invent one Golden Tongue. The Lawgiver bestows a language upon her mortal charges, and their language reinvents their thinking. She chooses:</p>
<ul>
<li>One specialty to bestow</li>
<li>One Ability to diminish</li>
<li>A number of Intimacies to build or erode equal to her Linguistics</li>
<li>A number of hampered traits equal to her Linguistics</li>
<li>A number of assisted traits equal to her (Linguistics ÷ 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time a person speaks the language, he permanently gains the specialty, but loses a dot from the diminished Ability. He counts hampered traits as being one higher for determining experience costs and trait maximums. He treats assisted traits as being one lower for those same purposes. Every scene a character speaks this language counts as a scene building or eroding one of the encoded Intimacies.  Essence-users are immune to the magical repercussions of speaking a Golden Tongue.</p>
<p>Golden tongues lose potency if their purity is diminished. Linguistic drift must be battled constantly by the vigilant Lawgiver.</p>
<p>This Charm may be re-purchased an unlimited number of times to produce additional Golden Tongues.</p>

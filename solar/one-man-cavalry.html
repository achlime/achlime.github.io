        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a hero rides away, he may be headed toward battle. Formation lines break and the wicked scatter at the Solar&rsquo;s terrifying battle charge. A Solar may use this Charm when emerging from a position of cover, such as smashing in through a window or leaping down from an overland pass; the Charm may also always enhance a mounted Join Battle roll. The Solar&rsquo;s player makes a (Charisma + Ride) roll, opposed by his opponents&rsquo; MDVs. Each opponent whose MDV fails to protect her is awestruck by the Lawgiver&rsquo;s emergence onto the battlefield, and suffers a -3 internal penalty to all attacks directed at the Solar or her mount, and a -1 internal penalty to all attacks against the Solar&rsquo;s allies. This unnatural mental influence costs (6 – target&rsquo;s Valor) points of Willpower to resist, producing immunity to any further uses by the same Solar for the rest of the scene.</p>
<p>Used in mass combat, this Charm may enhance a charge by the Lawgiver, causing it to count as a rout condition. Only the Solar need be mounted for this Charm to be activated, but if she is leading a cavalry charge by a mounted complementary unit, then the rout check is made at +1 difficulty. One Man Cavalry may not be activated more than once per action in this fashion.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The authority of a Lawgiver with this Charm is inescapable. The Solar is capable of making social attacks against her Lunar mate while he is under the effects of this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite, enhanced by any desired Presence or Performance Charms, regardless of the distance separating them. This communication is one-way. The Solar cannot sense her mate&rsquo;s state of mind or read his thoughts. Though the Solar&rsquo;s player always dictates use of this Charm, characters sometimes use Soul-Spanning Bridge Method unconsciously, imposing their idle thoughts and desires on their mate unintentionally.</p>
<p>Despite numerous attempts throughout the First Age, no Lunar has ever been able to design Charms permitting him to exercise power over his Solar mate through their spiritual bond.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Speaking a condemnation into the world, the Lawgiver&rsquo;s eyes blaze like twin suns, while the rest of him darkens like the onset of night. Laying a hand upon his target, the Solar curses him with the gaze of the wrathful sun. While this Charm remains in effect, sunlight itself becomes the eyes of the Solar…and the target knows it. Wherever she should go, she feels the Solar&rsquo;s gaze upon her in the light of the sun. As a result, the target feels constantly watched and followed—even indoors, she can feel the baleful sun dogging her every step. As a result, all Awareness rolls to detect hidden characters are made at a -3 external penalty; the character cannot sort out true feelings of being watched from the ever-present oppression of the sun. This unnatural Illusion costs one Willpower to resist for a scene, and cannot be made to permanently vanish until the Solar lifts his curse. Moreover, the feelings instilled by this Charm are not wholly false—the sun&rsquo;s light shows the Solar all of the target&rsquo;s failings. Whenever the target fails a Virtue roll or spends Willpower to suppress a Virtue while touched by the light of the sun, the Solar is granted a vision of the target&rsquo;s moment of selfcompromise. If the target is a creature of darkness, the sun&rsquo;s heat stifles them even indoors or at night; the character suffers a -1 external penalty to all actions while this Charm remains in effect. If in direct sunlight, such wretches suffer a blistering heat environmental effect (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 131).</p>
<p>At Awareness 6+, Essence 6+ the Solar may use an enhanced version of this Charm costing six motes. Used in this fashion, all targets suffer the effects reserved for creatures of darkness, above. Additionally, if the Solar voluntarily ends this Charm by withdrawing committed Essence, creatures of darkness spontaneously combust in a blaze of sunfire, suffering a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage 10A, Trauma 5.</p>
<p>With Awareness 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may issue a summons to targets afflicted with either version of this Charm, so long as they are within one mile of her. The summons is Obvious to the target&rsquo;s senses, as is the location where the Solar expects to meet (also within the same one-mile radius). The target has one day to reach this meeting point, and must arrive in broad daylight. Should she fail to do so, she will be branded with the Creature of Darkness mutation as a Shaping effect. At this level Solars may also target mortals with Falling Sun Eyes simply by speaking their name, dispensing with the Touch Keyword. This is a favored method used by the Night Caste to summon alleged criminals to face trial by the law.</p>

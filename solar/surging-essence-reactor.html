            <p>Like the sun they emulate, the Solar Exalted draw unlimited power by their very existence. Surging Essence Reactor upgrades all Overdrive Charms the Solar possesses. Whenever he would gain offensive motes from one of them, he may choose to instead convert them into attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Solar&rsquo;s Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Solar may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</p>

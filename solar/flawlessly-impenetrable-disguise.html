        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>After the Usurpation, the last of the Iron Wolves used this Charm to move in secret among the armies of the Dragon-Blooded. This Charm involves creating a disguise, and the player rolls ([Wits or Manipulation] + Larceny) to determine the disguise&rsquo;s quality.</p>
<p>This Charm allows the character to change his coloration, skin texture, hair color, and eye color. It also lets the character seem anywhere between half and twice his actual age, change his apparent ethnicity, change his apparent gender and adjust his height by as much as 10% in either direction. The character can adjust his voice, accent, speaking style and scent to match. These aspects of the disguise are impenetrable—the flaws are too subtle for the eye to see or the ear to hear, so that ordinary Awareness and Investigation cannot detect them. Characters with inhuman sensory acuity, such as Lawgivers using <a class="complex" href="keen-sense-technique.html" title="interpolation entry of charm 'Keen (Sense) Technique'"><span class="link-focus">Keen Sight Technique</span></a> or a dog scenting its master, can see through the character&rsquo;s disguise, but the opposed roll incurs a +4 difficulty penalty.</p>
<p>This Charm does not help the character imitate others&rsquo; appearance. The disguise is impenetrable, not exact. If someone sees through an imitation, they will see the character as an imposter who happens to naturally look almost exactly like the target the character is impersonating.</p>
<p>This Charm becomes a mundane disguise effect when the magic ends. Changes worked with makeup, posture, attitude and costume rather than Essence remain.</p>

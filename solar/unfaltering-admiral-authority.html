        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Even as her crew mates are falling, the Solar refuses to give up her vessel. The Solar&rsquo;s anima erupts into an aureate corona which washes over a ship she owns or commands. The magic quickly sinks into the boards of the vessel, visible only by the lanyards which untie themselves, the sails which raise and lower in accordance to the Lawgiver&rsquo;s will, and the other processes by which the ship tends to its own upkeep and basic operation.</p>
<p>So long as this Charm remains in effect (Sail + Essence) positions of the ship&rsquo;s skeleton crew are filled by the Lawgiver&rsquo;s will alone, in effect reducing the required skeleton crew. Any activation of this Charm that is not in reaction to crew falling in battle, or becoming otherwise incapable of fulfilling their duties despite their willingness to do so, has a three motes surcharge. Multiple activations of this charm reduce the required skeleton crew further, until it reaches zero.</p>
<p>This Charm is only capable of replacing unskilled labour, it cannot replace roles such as navigator, ballista crew, or lookout. These roles must be taken up by actual sailors, be they the Solar herself or part of a skeleton crew. However, for purposes of determining crew aptitude and efficiency the labour provided by this Charm counts as if provided by a crew with a Sail rating of (Essence).</p>
<p>So long as the Solar remains within (Sail x 100) yards of the ship, she may direct its course as though she were on board as a reflexive action.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Unstoppable Dreadnought Command (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/ruthless-captain-efficiency.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Ruthless Captain Efficiency'"><span class="link-focus">Ruthless Captain Efficiency</span></a>). This Charm operates by filling vacant positions on the ship with murky apparitions drawn from the Abyssal’s anima. It is otherwise identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

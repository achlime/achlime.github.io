        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar heroes are as one with their mounts. This Charm lets a character use his reflexive Charms to assist a loyal animal he is riding rather than himself. This counts as the character using that Charm, but adds one mote to its invocation cost. Because this counts as the character using the Charm, it must abide by all of the normal limitations on Charm invocation. For example, the character can&rsquo;t use a Martial Arts Excellency to enhance an attack and also use <a class="complex" href="reflex-sidestep-technique.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Reflex Sidestep Technique'"><span class="link-focus">Reflex Sidestep Technique</span></a> to help his mount dodge in the same action without a Combo. However, he could use either of these to help both himself and the horse in a single action. If the character has a self-invoking CHarm, such as <a class="complex" href="surprise-anticipation-method.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Surprise Anticipation Method'"><span class="link-focus">Surprise Anticipation Method</span></a>, then it invokes to protect his mount as well. If the mount faces unexpected mortal danger, the character reflexively spends two motes to enhance the mount&rsquo;s Awareness and allow it to shy.</p>

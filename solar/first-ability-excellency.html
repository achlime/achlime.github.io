        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lawgivers with this Charm are known for their moments of brilliance. <strong>The Exalt&rsquo;s player can invoke this charm whan making a roll based on the relevant Ability. This Charm then adds one die to that roll for each mote spent.</strong> This Charm is the paradigmatic dice adder. The rule that Solars are prohibited from increasing a dice pool by more than their (Attribute + Ability) almost always refers to the purchase of dice through the use of this Charm.</p>
<p>Characters can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability, usually to increase a Defense Value, for example, by increasing (Dexterity + Dodge) to protect against a physical attack. When enhancing static values, her player rolls one die for each mote spent on the First Excellency. Each success increases her effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for the task by two. <strong>Therefore, each success on the First Excellency roll increases an applicable static value by one.</strong></p>
<p>Characters cannot use this or other Excellencies or dice-adding Charms to &ldquo;create&rdquo; actions. For example, if a character attacks on tick 3 and will attack again on tick 8, she cannot buy dice for an attack on tick 4 that only exists because she used the Excellency to conjure dice for it. A character who uses this or other reflexive Charms to add to an attack can also use it to enhance her <em>defense</em> until the next when she acts, but she must spend Essence for each separate roll she wishes to modify.</p>
<p>This Charm can be part of a Combo or used together with the Second Excellency, but it is incompatibly with the Third Excellency. It can never be used on the same roll as the Third Excellency.</p>

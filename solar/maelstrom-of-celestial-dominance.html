        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar focuses the apocalyptic might of his Essence into a weapon and hurls it out into the world, where it becomes a vortex annihilation formed of ten thousand glittering blades. The character makes a single Thrown attack with a readied weapon. This attack is unblockable and undodgeable, and applies to every character within a line (Essence x 3) yards wide, (Essence x 2) yards high, and (Thrown) miles long. At Thrown 8+, Essence 8+ the Charm&rsquo;s distance extends to (Thrown x 3) miles.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm at Thrown 7+, Essence 7+ upgrades its destructive power to the point that the attack lacerates the very fabric of the cosmos. A million whitehot cuts sizzle in the air, leaving behind a ragged white scar of sunfire. This acts as an environmental attack within the area covered by the Charm&rsquo;s initial attack with Damage 3L/action (Damage 3A/action as a Holy effect against creatures of darkness), Trauma 3. This scar lingers for (Solar&rsquo;s Essence) hours. The Lawgiver is advised to be wary of this barrier, as he is not immune to its power.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Bone-Filled Maelstrom Gust (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/burrowing-bone-maggot.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Burrowing Bone Maggot'"><span class="link-focus">Burrowing Bone Maggot</span></a>). The jagged, weeping slits its repurchase leaves in the fabric of the world radiate the power of Oblivion and have no Holy aspect. The Charm is otherwise identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

            <p>Essence enhances the Solar&rsquo;s senses. Keen (Sense) Technique is actually three Charms, one that heightens sight, one that heightens hearing and touch and one that heightens smell and taste.</p>
<p>This Charm gives two bonus successes on Awareness actions that use the relevant senses. it also allows the character to cleanly perceive sensory imporessions that are notmally to faint for human senses to validly observe at all. Some feats appropriate for uses of the Charm follow.</p>
<p><strong>Sight.</strong> The character can make out the detail on a commander&rsquo;s epaulet at 500 yards distance, at night. he can see the individual threads of a short, and with a legendary success he can make out the motion of mites that live on other&rsquo;s eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing and Touch.</strong> The character can gauge the quality of fabrice with a touch. He reduces the external penalty to target unseen characters to -1 and the internal penalty from blindness to -2. he can hear conversations normally through thick stone walls. With a legendary success, he can read by touch.</p>
<p><strong>Smell and Taste.</strong> The character can recognize others and hints of their recent activities by smell. he can track by scent, gaining one bonus success when tracking someone who has a scent. The character can identify species and poisons by taste. With a legendary success, he can detect but not identify a few drops of tasteless poison in a wine—as its presence serves to dilute the wine.</p>

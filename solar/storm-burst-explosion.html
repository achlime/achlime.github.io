        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm upgrades its prerequisites, allowing the Solar to pay six motes, one Willpower to activate Lightning Strikes Twice against multiple opponents simultaneously. The Solar may make a single unexpected attack against (Dexterity + 3) targets, with the same rules and limitations as Lightning Strikes Twice. During this time he is seen to blur across the sky in every direction, flashing from target to target, striking blows against each while his anima flares and strobes like the violent concatenation of a lightning storm. Using Storm Burst Explosion counts as an activation of Lightning Strikes Twice, preventing the Solar from re-using that Charm unless he has Split the Chase. Should the character use Heaven Thunder Hammer and Split the Chase to reactivate Lightning Strikes Twice against multiple opponents through the use of this Charm, the arc of flashing recursions is seen to crawl ever outward from the center of impact, leaving blazing jags across the sky and flashing at each point of impact. This attack may be driven through a third iteration through the application of <a class="complex" href="flicker-fade-recursion.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Flicker-Fade Recursion'"><span class="link-focus">Flicker-Fade Recursion</span></a>.</p>
<p>As with Lightning Strikes Twice, the character may opt not to follow his opponents, choosing instead to make an unexpected ranged attack against each of them. This attack follows the same rules as those in Lightning Strikes Twice, except that the Exalt splits this attack amongst multiple opponents. When using Storm Burst Explosion, the character may select which valid targets to strike and may choose to ignore valid targets, allowing them to collide with scenery per the rules of <a class="complex" href="../martial-arts/heaven-thunder-hammer.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Heaven Thunder Hammer'"><span class="link-focus">Heaven Thunder Hammer</span></a>.</p>

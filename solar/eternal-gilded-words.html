        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a touch of his hand, the Solar&rsquo;s Essence renders a message imperishable. This Charm may enchant anything from a wall of graffiti to an entire book, as long as that surface bears a message the character wishes to preserve. While Essence remains committed to the Charm, the letters cannot be erased or defaced. If the enchanted words are contained in a medium designed to hold writing (such as a book or scroll), that object becomes indestructible for the Charm&rsquo;s duration. Messages scrawled onto surfaces intended for some other purpose are only impossible to remove or deface. The underlying object or structure may still be destroyed, though merely damaging it will not reduce the words&rsquo; legibility. The enchanted words shine through anything placed over them as though they were a Solar caste mark shining at the four- to seven- mote level of display, and are faintly luminous in the dark.</p>

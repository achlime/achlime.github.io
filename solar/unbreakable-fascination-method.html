        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar&rsquo;s words blaze with power, fascinating others. This Charm is a dramatic action to speak before a crowd. It flares the Solar&rsquo;s anima to the 16+ mote level while in use. The rhythm and poetry of the Solar&rsquo;s words become a transcendent numinous experience for those who hear him speak.</p>
<p>This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on all who hear compelling them to listen raptly. This is automatically successful unless opposed by a defensive Charm. In addition, the Exalt&rsquo;s player rolls (Charisma + Linguistics), and if the successes defeat a target&rsquo;s MDV, that target is compelled to fall to his knees in awe, weep with rapture or otherwise react as appropriate to the presence and oration of a creature greater than a god. To resist one or both compulsions for a single action, the target must either have his player succeed on a Temperance roll, or he must spend one Willpower. The target need never spend more Willpower than the Solar&rsquo;s Essence in any given scene to resist Unbreakable Fascination Method.</p>
<p>This Charm ends when the Solar interrupts his speech for any reason other than a dramatic pause—that is, when he takes some other action.</p>

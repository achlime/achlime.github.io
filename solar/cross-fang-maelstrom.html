        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Turning inward, drawing down, the Cross-Fang Maelstrom is a phantom storm birthed in the heart of the righteous. The character must have at least three stocked free reflexive attacks in order to channel this attack against her target. The Solar expends up to (Dexterity + 3) free reflexive attacks upon activation, allowing the character to create a flurry consisting of an equal number of Melee attacks against a single opponent. All attacks in this flurry are made at the Solar&rsquo;s full dice pool, and the flurry has a total DV penalty equal to the highest penalty on any single attack in the flurry. Upon activation, the player decides how many attacks to launch against the target, but may unleash no fewer than three attacks. Treat each of the attacks as if they were the result of a coordinated attack effort (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 144), with each attack lowering the target&rsquo;s DV by an equal number. This effect stacks with the successes from coordinating an attack, but only the Exalt&rsquo;s attacks benefit from the increased target DV reduction caused by this Charm. If the target flees the Solar&rsquo;s flurry through the use of Charms such as Leaping Dodge Method, the Solar regains a number of free reflexive attacks equal to the number of attacks remaining when the opponent moved out of range.</p>

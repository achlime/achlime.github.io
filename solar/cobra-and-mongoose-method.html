            <p>The Lawgiver matches his motions to that of an opponent&rsquo;s weapon, making sure that the targeted blade can strike him no more than it can cut its own shadow. This Charm acts as a permanent enhancement to Seven Shadow Evasion, allowing it to be invoked with a two-mote surcharge. This extends its duration to &ldquo;One action,&rdquo; but allows it only to be applied to a single weapon carried by a single opponent (natural weapons such as a Lunar Exalt&rsquo;s claws or a martial artist&rsquo;s kicks are valid targets for this purpose). The Charm may not be re-invoked with this enhanced benefit to change targets to a different weapon before its duration elapses, nor may the duration be canceled early by releasing Essence commitment. Seven Shadow Evasion may still simultaneously be invoked at its normal cost to deal with other attacks.</p>

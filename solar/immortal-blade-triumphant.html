        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lawgiver channels the blinding radiance of his anima banner through his blade, empowering it as an icon of his martial legend and heroic triumph. While Immortal Blade Triumphant is active, the Solar&rsquo;s anima banner emanates from a chosen weapon, not from his person. At the lowest levels of anima flare, this channeling suffuses the enchanted blade with the light and colors of the Lawgiver&rsquo;s banner; at higher levels, the anima banner emanates from the enchanted blade itself, taking on the shape of the weapon it shines from. This Charm ends if the chosen weapon leaves the Lawgiver&rsquo;s hands, but his will alone is capable of breaking the bond. The weapon cannot be destroyed or disarmed, nor is it affected by magic that would break the Solar&rsquo;s attunement to it.</p>
<p>As the vessel of the Solar&rsquo;s anima and personal legend, the enchanted weapon resonates with his heroic will, adding any dice from stunting or channeled Virtues to damage rolls as well as attack rolls. The overwhelming Essence pressure of the anima surrounding the weapon also magnifies the weapon&rsquo;s strength, both to lay waste to the Lawgiver&rsquo;s enemies and to shield him from harm. Any damage rolls made with the weapon convert up to (Essence) dice to automatic successes, and parrying with it adds (Essence) to the Solar&rsquo;s DV.</p>
<p>Should the Solar have need of power beyond even this, then he may unleash the triumphant power of his martial legend in a single devastating attack. While his anima banner is flaring at the 16m+ level, he may choose to discharge this Charm through an attack. Doing so adds (Essence) automatic success to the damage roll instead of converting dice to successes, and allows the attack to bypass both soak and Hardness. Calling upon this power ends this Charm and resets the Solar&rsquo;s anima banner to the 0m level.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Charnel Emperor Stance (Prerequisite Charms: <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/artful-maiming-onslaught.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Artful Maiming Onslaught'"><span class="link-focus">Artful Maiming Onslaught</span></a>, <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/blade-summoning-gesture.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Blade-Summoning Gesture'"><span class="link-focus">Blade-Summoning Gesture</span></a>, <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/fluttering-moth-defense.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Fluttering Moth Defense'"><span class="link-focus">Fluttering Moth Defense</span></a>). Black Essence spills over the Abyssal&rsquo;s weapon, darkening it until it seems he wields a fragment of Oblivion itself. His blade becomes a manifest eschatology, an unholy incarnation of all his dark majesty and fatal prowess. This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart, except that it does not add stunt or Virtue dice to damage rolls. Instead, the Abyssal&rsquo;s blade dissolves and unmakes whatever it touches, dealing aggravated damage to everything.</p>

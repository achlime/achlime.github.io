            <p>The Solar&rsquo;s vessel shouts his legend into the world. This Charm may only be used aboard a ship the Solar owns. The identity of the vessel&rsquo;s owner becomes Obvious to all characters who perceive it. Should they be unaware of the Solar by reputation or personal association, Mariner&rsquo;s Parable Defense makes it clear—the Exalt is a legendary man of the sea: a hero who sinks pirates, rescues damsels in distress, puts storm gods in their place, braves hurricanes and defies the Yozis; or a peerless pirate who ransacks port towns, evades capture with a laugh, and steals comely lads or lasses with as much ease and abandon as casks of jade. Should the Solar&rsquo;s ship put into port while this Charm is in effect, this aura follows the character wherever he should go, up to (Essence) miles from the ship.</p>
<p>Common folk marvel at the Solar&rsquo;s heroism or cringe before his rapacity—he raises his Appearance and MDVs by three with regard to all characters struck by this aura. Additionally, fear of the Solar&rsquo;s prowess imposes a -1 external penalty to all attacks directed at his person or his ship. This unnatural mental influence costs two Willpower to resist for a scene.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Solar gains one temporary dot of Influence while this Charm is active.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Bearing knives like lupine fangs, the Iron Wolves know that the best defense is a good offense. A character invokes this Charm after using her Dodge DV to defend against an attack. The Exalt flashes out of existence, dodging toward her opponent in an effort to gain the advantage of surprise. The character moves up to (10 + [Strength x Dodge] x 3) yards toward her opponent in a blur of untraceable speed, reappearing immediately on the next tick, rendering her an invalid target for this Charm&rsquo;s duration. This Charm&rsquo;s effects take place in step 10 after resolving the attack that provoked it. The character may use this Charm to pass through solid structures, but she may not use it against an opponent who is inside her engagement range, nor may she enhance the distance this Charm will carry her through the use of hearthstones, artifacts, sorcery, or other Charms. This Charm may not be used to move away from an opponent.</p>
<p>If the Lawgiver must close the gap now, she may pay five motes, one Willpower to flash forward up to 300 yards. If her opponent is inside this range, he finds the Lawgiver suddenly at his neck, making a counterattack with the Ability of her choice, turning this Charm&rsquo;s duration to Instant. If her target is not in range, the Lawgiver may not activate this version of Night&rsquo;s Avenger Lunge.</p>
<p>At Essence 5+, the character may use Night&rsquo;s Avenger Lunge to counter attacks made against her from up to 100 miles away by paying ten motes, one Willpower. This also provides a counterattack and turns the duration of this Charm to Instant.</p>

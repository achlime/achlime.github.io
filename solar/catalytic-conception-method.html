            <p>In the first age, procreation is the mandate of the dragon-blooded. However, the lawgiver&rsquo;s indomitable perfection infuses every aspect of his life, even those aspects usually considered irrelevant. Unwilling to accept anything but perfection, this charm allows the lawgiver to sire perfect offspring.</p>
<p>When the chosen of the sun activates this charm at the appropriate moment, he will sire a perfect child. The solar counts as having the Breeding background, at one dot higher than his partner, but only if his partner has the background. For the purposes of this charm, Dragon Blooded without the Breeding background count as having the background at a rating of 0. Furthermore, the child will have attributes as if it were a heroic mortal, and will be conceived regardless of mundane contraception. This charm has a second, if more obscure use: when a 2 mote surcharge is paid, the solar can perfectly prevent conception.</p>
<p>This charm constitutes a perfect fertility or perfect infertility effect. If it comes into conflict with another such effect, perfect infertility is considered to trump perfect fertility.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The killer instinct of the Solar Hero is sufficient to break an opponent&rsquo;s strategy. Whenever the Solar uses a Martial Arts attack to do at least three lethal or aggravated or six bashing health levels of damage to his opponent, he may pay five motes to remove that damage from the attack. This may reduce levels of damage inflicted on his opponent to 0. Instead of taking the full damage of the Solar&rsquo;s attack, his victim&rsquo;s Form is broken; that is, if his opponent had a Form-type Martial Arts Charm active, a successful application of Stance Breaker Instinct removes it from the target. Victims of this attack may still find themselves injured or killed by the attack. As a point of clarification, if the attack on the damage does more than three lethal or six bashing levels, the remaining health levels of damage still apply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Exalt may not knock the same Martial Arts Form-type Charm off her target more than once in ten actions. Having knocked her opponent out of form, she may attack different Form-types her opponent assumes before ten actions have been completed, but doing so resets the ten action count for all Form-type Charms she has knocked off her opponent in the current battle. For example, the Lawgiver may punch her opponent hard enough to knock him out of Tiger Form; five actions later, she knocks him out of Snake Form; she may not remove either Tiger or Snake Form from her opponent for another ten actions. As a further point of clarity, two or more Solars attacking a single opponent with this Charm track these actions separately.</p>

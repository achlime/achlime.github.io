            <p>That which the Solars have brought into the world, they may take away with a word. The shinma shiver as the Solar utters a condemnation into the cosmos, consigning to destruction a bureaucratic organization he has created. The Lawgiver&rsquo;s player rolls (Willpower + Bureaucracy) against a difficulty of the ([Wits + Bureaucracy + Essence] ÷ 2) of the head of the targeted organization. Should this roll succeed, the targeted organization will collapse into utter ruin over the course of the next season: its employees resign, papers catch fire, office buildings are flooded or collapse into sinkholes. The Solar immediately gains a number of motes equal to twice the Magnitude of individuals employed by the targeted organization.</p>
<p>Alternate functions of this Charm exist, if the Solar has a rating of 6+ in the appropriate Ability:</p>
<p>With Craft 6+ the Solar may irreparably compromise artifacts and manses he has created, causing the magic to leak out of them. A daiklave simply becomes an inert hunk of orichalcum, while a manse will no longer channel Essence—it is simply a building sitting in a demesne. Roll (Willpower + Craft) against a difficulty of the owner&rsquo;s ([Wits + Craft + Essence] ÷ 2). Success restores (rating x 2) motes.</p>
<p>With Occult 6+, the Solar may rend asunder spells he has cast, restoring (Spell&rsquo;s Circle x 3) motes.</p>
<p>With Lore 6+, the Solar may dissolve a landscape he created with a single invocation of Wyld-Shaping Technique back into the chaos from which it arose, restoring five motes.</p>
<p>With Integrity 6+, the Solar may destroy one of his own Intimacies, so long as he has held it for at least one season, restoring five motes.</p>
<p>This Charm may be activated no more than once per scene.</p>

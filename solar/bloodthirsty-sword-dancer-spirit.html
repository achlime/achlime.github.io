        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When ordinary means have failed, and there is nothing left save life or death, then it befits the god-kings of legend to give themselves over to the battle-trance and make themselves implacable enemies to their foes. This Charm functions as <a class="complex" href="battle-fury-focus.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Battle Fury Focus'"><span class="link-focus">Battle Fury Focus</span></a> but is in all ways greater. It gives the character three extra dice to all combat-related pools and removes all wound penalties. The character&rsquo;s mind is consumed by the battle-trance. The character cannot speak coherently and cannot retreat. She may only take one or more of the following actions: moving towards her current target by the shortest route, attacking enemies within range, waiting for an attacker to engage her or selecting the nearest enemy as a new target when her previous target is incapacitated, dead or not locatable.</p>
<p>This Charm lasts until the character can no longer locate an enemy to kill. Enemies include known enemies and those who get in her way. Strangers and acquaintance can earn the enemy label if they are dressed like the enemy or if they act in a suspicious fashion. The character will not attack close friends, relatives or lovers for suspicious actions or clothing—they must actively interfere to become targets of attack.</p>
<p>To end this Charm prematurely, the Solar must spend three Willpower and gain one Limit. Reduce this to one Willpower and no Limit of a loved on or friend attempts to restrain the character. Unfortunately, if the Exalted does not spend the Willpower when a loved on attempts to break her battle-trance, she is almost certain to lash out at the unrecognizable blur distracting her from slaying her target.</p>

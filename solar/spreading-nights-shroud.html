            <p>The Lawgivers were meant to work together to bring order to Creation, but the Night Caste has always found fulfilling this mandate difficult. This Charm helps the Iron Wolves stand side by side with their less subtle brethren. The Lawgiver need only touch a consenting ally and commit two motes to tag him as a beneficiary. Up to maximum of (Stealth rating) beneficiaries may be tagged simultaneously.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries use the Solar&rsquo;s traits (if higher) for all rolls to remain undetected. Additionally, whenever the Solar activates another Stealth Charm or Stealth-related anima power while using Spreading Night&rsquo;s Shroud, she must pay two extra motes per beneficiary. This surcharge extends the effect through the tag, hiding the beneficiary just as it hides the Solar. Should the Lawgiver or any beneficiary do anything that qualifies as an attack, however, all the Lawgiver&rsquo;s shared effects instantly terminate, preventing an unexpected attack.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Even in chains a Solar may bring an enemy to his knees. This Charm is identical to Break the Storm, but for the following exceptions: the character may only activate this Charm when he is in a clinch he does not control; this attack is unexpected, and may only be made against opponents who are attempting to attack the Lawgiver while he is being grappled. This Charm guarantees the primacy of this strike; even if all his limbs are bound, the Solar will get a limb momentarily free, or otherwise land a crushing headbutt. This attack does not allow him to escape the clinch; he remains under the control of the clinching opponent until he can win control of the grapple. This Charm has a special interaction with Heaven Thunder Hammer. If the target uses a perfect soak effect to block the damage from a combo in which Chained Thunder Strike and Heaven Thunder Hammer have been triggered simultaneously, the force of the Solar&rsquo;s attack is redirected back through his body at the opponent who is holding him, applying its raw damage to the controlling clincher. If this unexpected attack does damage, both the Lawgiver and the foe clinching him are hurled backwards per the effects of Heaven Thunder Hammer. If they collide with a solid surface, only the Solar&rsquo;s opponent takes any damage from the collision. Chained Thunder Strike is incompatible with <a class="complex" href="lightning-strikes-twice.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Lightning Strikes Twice'"><span class="link-focus">Lightning Strikes Twice</span></a>.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When a Solar avows another of the idea that they own something, he is being generous; when he grows bored of pretending, he simply takes what he wants. This Charm supplements a blatant attempt to strip something from another person (treat as a disarm attempt using Larceny in the place of a combat Ability). The character explicitly can steal things in active use, such as weapons, clothing, or even armor, so long as he can reach them, or any object on the target&rsquo;s person which he is aware of (examples might include a coin purse held in a clenched fist inside of a pocket, a sheathed sword the target is menacingly fingering the hilt of, or the target&rsquo;s undergarments).</p>
<p>At Essence 5+, the Exalt may steal attuned artifacts, instantly breaking the artifact&rsquo;s attunement in the process.</p>
<p>With Larceny 6+, Essence 6+, the Exalt may reflexively and instantly attune a stolen artifact by paying its commitment cost.</p>
<p>With Larceny 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may use King of Thieves Spirit to steal Alchemical Charms, though he may not attune to them. At Larceny 8+, Essence 8+ even this restriction vanishes, and the Solar may equip and wield a stolen Alchemical Charm, if he has an open Charm Slot in which to place it.</p>
<p>All attempts to steal armor suffer a -2 external penalty.</p>

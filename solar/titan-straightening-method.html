            <p>To be caught in the grip of an enraged Solar is a terrifying prospect, for their mighty hands may rend even the makers of the universe. The Solar may activate this Charm to enhance a crush action when she has control of a clinch. No matter how large the opponent, the Lawgiver&rsquo;s strain pulls her foe into the air over her head, where she may shake it violently, causing its bones, organs, limbs—or souls—to smash together, colliding repeatedly as the Solar thrashes her victim like a ragdoll. The Solar re-applies steps 7-10 of attack resolution (Essence - 1) times, repeatedly damaging her victim. The damage of all applications is applied simultaneously in Step 10, allowing a single perfect soak to defend against all of them.</p>
<p>If the target is warstrider-sized or larger, double the raw damage from these attacks. If the target is a landscape-scale or larger (such as Mount Mostath), multiply the raw damage by five. Used against such enormous targets, the Charm becomes Obvious.</p>

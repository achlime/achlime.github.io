        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Often in everyday life in Creation, sex is an explosive activity. It could be morally abhorred by others, contagious, and even life-threatening. This occurs because sex is a very special activity associated with various rituals and traditions in almost every culture, civilized or no. In other cases sex is a very emotional activity, but strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>This charm copies the emotions from a potential sexual encounter into another activity, such as dancing, hugging, playing cards or simple conversation. In effect, everyone playing hide and seek with someone using this charm will feel as they just had consensual (provided that the hide and seek was consensual) sex with the person. In a sense, this is an extreme form of indirect seduction, because having actual sex with the Solar is regarded as a very natural thing to do for any subjects of the charm since they are emotionally ready.</p>
<p>While this charm is active everyone participating in the activity has their Tenacity against seduction attempts reduced by 3 due to Familiarity and may not add Temperance to their tenacity. Furthermore this charm lets the Solar know if any participants of the divine activity truly loves her. This charm is explicitly permitted to supplement actions using other Abilities.</p>

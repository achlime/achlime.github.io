        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Never again shall a Lawgiver suffer being apart from her blades. A character with this Charm may pay one mote to indefinitely store (Essence x 2) weapons Elsewhere, including close- and long-range weapons. This Charm also expressly permits the storage of shields. Thousand Arms Prana is Stackable; the Solar may reflexively store as many weapons as she wishes Elsewhere, at a rate of one mote per (Essence x 2) weapons. In order to retrieve a weapon stored in this manner, the Solar must concentrate on that weapon and pay an additional mote, causing the weapon to fall to the ground at her feet. The character may also use Charms such as <a class="complex" href="elegant-dance-of-bow-and-blade.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Elegant Dance of Bow and Blade'"><span class="link-focus">Elegant Dance of Bow and Blade</span></a> to draw her weapons from Elsewhere.</p>
<p>As long as the Solar maintains an Essence commitment to this Charm, she may sheath weapons in Elsewhere without cost, up to her storage limit. Releasing the motes committed to storing her weapons in Elsewhere causes them to fall to the ground around the character in a circle ([Essence x 2] x [number of committed motes released]) yards in diameter. Her weapons do not become immediately tangible, but rather they glow with ghostly blue-white flames, and though they appear to be embedded all throughout the scenery, they can neither be grasped nor moved by anyone but the Lawgiver for one hour, after which the flames disperse and the weaponry rejoins existence. Should she commit motes back to Thousand Arms Prana before the hour&rsquo;s end, she may instantly banish her emblazoned weaponry with a thought if she so chooses, or may otherwise place new weaponry into Elsewhere for the duration of this commitment. If the Solar grasps an emblazoned weapon at any point before the hour ends, the weapon immediately re-enters existence and becomes tangible to characters other than the Solar. Should a Lawgiver die while using this Charm, her weapons do not spring from Elsewhere, but rather float through the pocket-space of not-here, individual weapons falling into Creation and other realms of existence across (Essence) months from the character&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Finally, purchasing this Charm grants the Solar an experience point refund for the cost of its prerequisite.</p>

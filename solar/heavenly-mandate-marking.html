        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The world knows those whom the Lawgivers claim as their own. The Solar touches a character who has just expressed a pledge of loyalty to him. In a flash of light, a golden brand depicting the Solar&rsquo;s anima icon painlessly appears at the point of contact and then disappears. Most First Age Solars chose to mark their underlings&rsquo; brows.</p>
<p>This mark is permanent, reappearing whenever the target performs an action at the direct behest of his Solar lord and declares that his labors are performed on behalf of a Prince of Creation. The Solar may withdraw the brand as a miscellaneous action at any time, inflicting one automatic level of lethal damage.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm, at Bureaucracy 5+, Essence 4+, allows the Solar to activate this Charm to cause a servant&rsquo;s brand to flare to visibility if the servant is within the same realm of existence as the Lawgiver. As long as the Solar takes no other action, he may observe and hear what transpires around his servant, with the brand as his fixed point of perspective. A third purchase, at Essence 5+, permits the Solar to use any of his Bureaucracy Charms through or on behalf of a remotely observed servant. These Charms base their effects and limitations on the Lawgiver&rsquo;s traits rather than the servant&rsquo;s.</p>

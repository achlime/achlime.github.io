        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The more terrible the enemies and adversities they face, the greater the power of a Solar&rsquo;s spirit. This Charm grants the character an additional ten-mote peripheral Essence pool in accordance with the <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#overdrive" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Overdrive'"><span class="link-focus">Overdrive</span></a> Keyword. Whenever the Lawgiver is injured, she gains motes which are used to refill this pool: one mote for being struck by an attack without taking damage, two motes per point of bashing damage, or three motes per point of lethal or aggravated damage suffered.</p>
<p>Essence-Gathering Temper will only provide motes when the Solar is injured against her will; she may no more order a bound demon to assault her in order to obtain motes than she may gain them from stabbing herself. Health lost in order to pay the activation cost of a Charm likewise never produces motes.</p>
<p>At Essence 3+ the Solar may also refill her Overdrive pool when she perceives her allies being injured, at the same rate as though she were taking damage herself. In order to gain motes in this fashion, the Solar must directly perceive the character being injured at the moment the injury occurs, and must have a positive Intimacy toward that individual (the character&rsquo;s Lunar mate also always qualifies). Finally, the injuries may not be self-inflicted, as outlined above, and may not be inflicted by the Solar herself.</p>

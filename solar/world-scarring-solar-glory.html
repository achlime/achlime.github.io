        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar&rsquo;s weapon surges with the limitless power of the wrathful sun god. An attack supplemented by this Charm adds (Essence) dice of raw damage in Step Seven. Should the dice of damage to be rolled after soak in Step Eight exceed the target&rsquo;s maximum total health levels, the Solar may instead inflict as many or as few automatic levels of damage as desired.</p>
<p>At Essence 7+, this Charm may be used to inflict whatever level of damage the Lawgiver desires to nonmagical objects and structures up to the size of a palace. Cutting passes through hills or smashing down stout fortress gates are trivial exercises for such mighty heroes. At Melee 9+ the character may pay a five-mote surcharge upon activation to inflict as many or as few automatic levels of damage as desired to targets regardless of his total dice in Step Eight.</p>
<p>A second purchase, at Melee 8+, Essence 8+, allows the Solar to activate this Charm as a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV –1), and commit Essence to it to &ldquo;store&rdquo; it in advance. When the commitment is reflexively dropped (this must be done in Step One), the Charm activates without counting as a Charm use. At Essence 9+, the Solar may store up to (Essence/2) activations simultaneously, though each must have Essence committed to it separately.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Creation-Slaying Holocaust Blade (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="rising-sun-slash.html" title="mirror entry of charm 'Rising Sun Slash'"><span class="link-focus">Life-Severing Blade</span></a>). The Abyssal Mirror to World-Scarring Solar Glory has different prerequisites but is otherwise identical.</p>

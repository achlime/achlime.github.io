            <p>A Solar may learn to master all angles, trajectories, and speeds of attack—even those of his enemy. This Charm takes effect when the Solar is targeted by an attack, telling him the exact range and position of the character that made the attack. This does not allow the Solar to see his opponent; instead, his superior throwing skills allow him to calculate the angle of attack, making a perfect estimation of his assailant&rsquo;s position. At Essence 3+, the Solar gains a taste for the Essence signature of his attacker; when faced with more than one opponent whom he cannot see, the Exalt may tell the difference between them, even if they are constantly changing positions. This does not confer information about the identity of his attackers; he simply knows them by their attacks, making it possible to hone in on a particular opponent under changing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Stalking the Striker&rsquo;s Hand (Prerequisites: None). Abyssals are able to keenly sense killing intent when directed at them. This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

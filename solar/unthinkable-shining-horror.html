        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>It must not be forgotten that the inventor of Infernal Monster Style was a Solar akuma. Gorol was an abomination to his circle mates, a living rejection of everything he stood for. In forsaking any claim to heroism, the akuma made himself the perfect monster. Unthinkable Shining Horror is exclusively Native to Solar akuma and can&rsquo;t be learned by other beings. The Charm upgrades Infernal Monster Form, providing the following additional powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The akuma is not obligated to attack his Yozi master or any of its component Third Circle demons while in a berserk state (such as that induced by <a class="complex" href="../martial-arts/retribution-will-follow.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Retribution Will Follow'"><span class="link-focus">Retribution Will Follow</span></a>) unless said entities physically attacked him earlier in the scene.</li>
<li>The fallen Solar shocks those who love him, giving him a chance to slaughter them in their moment of hesitation. Characters with a positive Intimacy toward the akuma suffer an internal penalty of (the akuma&rsquo;s Essence) to all physical attacks targeting him. Resisting this unnatural Emotion effect for a scene costs five Willpower. Characters must have had the Intimacy for a minimum of one month to invoke the penalty. The horror afflicts loved ones, not awed strangers.</li>
<li>If the Exalt knows <a class="complex" href="../martial-arts/solar-hero-form.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Solar Hero Form'"><span class="link-focus">Solar Hero Form</span></a>, he may activate it simultaneously with Infernal Monster Form, paying the full cost of both Charms. The joint activation uses the highest Speed and DV penalty for both Charms and allows them to co-exist.</li>
<li>As an optional Blasphemy effect, the Solar akuma may shove aside the limitations of his Charms, raising his bonus dice cap to (Attribute + Ability + Essence) while enhancing unarmed attacks and parries. This power is optional and can be used at any point, but once reflexively invoked, it lasts until Infernal Monster Form ends.</li>
</ul>

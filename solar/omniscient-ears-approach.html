        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Hearing beyond hearing, the Lawgiver is supremely attuned to the tenor of his own Essence. Any utterance of his name by any individual anywhere in the same realm of existence becomes Obvious to his senses, as does the identity of the individual speaking his name. The Solar may reflexively spend 1m per long tick to hear exactly what the individual speaking his name is saying, and may continue to listen in for as long as he cares to spend Essence or has Essence to spend. He only hears the voice of individuals who have spoken his name, however; any replies that might occur are inaudible. At Awareness 7+, the Solar may hear his name when it is spoken by beings in other realms of existence.</p>
<p>All manner of wards against scrying automatically cause this Charm to fail; the Seal of Eight Divinities that separates Autochthonia from Creation is considered to be such a ward so long as it remains intact.</p>
<p>There exists a Linguistics Charm called <a class="complex" href="the-ever-vigilant-scribe.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'The Ever-Vigilant Scribe'"><span class="link-focus">The Ever-Vigilant Scribe</span></a>, which alerts the character if anyone writers his name.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm at Awareness 6+, Essence 6+ allows the Lawgiver to reflexively spend 5 Willpower to redefine the sound this Charm listens for. This must be a specific noise, rather than a general class of sounds; &ldquo;the sound of the Guide to Meru I handed to Arlot landing in a trash bin&rdquo; would qualify, as would &ldquo;someone speaking the name of my wife, Lilith,&rdquo; but &ldquo;anyone plotting against me&rdquo; or &ldquo;someone professing love to my wife, Lillith&rdquo; would not.</p>
<p>Abyssal Exalted, having cast their names away into Oblivion, cannot develop a Mirror to this Charm.</p>

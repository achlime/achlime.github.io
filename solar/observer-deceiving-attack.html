        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar&rsquo;s opponents are often arrogant and attempt to predict how and when the Lawgivers will strike. Such is their folly that they cannot see the vengeance of the Unconquered Sun even when it comes upon them. This Charm conceals a Thrown-based attack. Characters watching the Solar need (the Solar&rsquo;s Essence) successes on a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll to notice him making the attack. This success requirement decreases by one for each additional time the Solar uses this Charm in a scene. For characters not watching the Solar, all evidence indicates that the attack comes from a direction and distance named by the Solar when making the attack. For example, a Solar attacking from behind might wound an enemy in the side or chest by having his missile curve at the last moment.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar Exalted are infinite wells of talent. Each two motes committed to this Charm reduces the mote cost for the first (Ability) Excellencies by one, to a minimum of 0. Exalted with Essence 3 can spend up to six motes on this Charm, while Exalted with Essence 4+ can spend as many motes as they like.</p>
<p><em>Example: A character with Infinite Melee Mastery, a Melee 4, a Dexterity of 4 and an Essence of 3 could commit up to six motes to the Charm. This would reduce the cost of any given Melee Excellency by three motes. While the character is technically using a Charm fo the purposes of Combos, she could gain up to three bonus dice from the First Excellency on any action using Melee at a cost 0 motes. She could buy one success with the Second Excellency at not cost in motes or reduce the cost of the Third Excellency to one mote.</em></p>
<p><em>She could also gain one die with the First Excellency if the First and Second Excellencies were together in a Combo she had activated (see p. 244). <em>Any</em> additional effect—adding more dice or more success—would cost the normal price. So, the example chraacter could purchase up to eight bonus dice using the First Excellency and apply a three-mote discount to the total cost, so buying the maximum of eight dice would cost five motes.</em></p>
<p>Apply the discount to the total expenditure on Excellencies relating to a given roll. A character who spends motes on the Comboed effects of the First and Second Excellency does not receive the discount for the use of both Excellencies on a given roll. If the example character activated a Combo and spent fout motes to buy to successes on a roll with the Second Excellency and four motes to buy four dice using the First Excellency, the cost would be five motes ([4 + 4] - [3 for the six motes committed to the Infinite Melee Master]).</p>
<p>This Charm and the relevant discount are incompatible with any effect that invokes the effects of Excellencies as innate powers rather than as Charms. A character must have the Excellency in order to invoke it at a discount through the use of this Charm.</p>
<p>The discount of this Charm does not apply to dice purchased over the Solar&rsquo;s normal dice limit with <a class="complex" href="ability-essence-flow.html" title="canonical entry of charm '(Ability) Essence Flow'"><span class="link-focus">(Ability) Essence Flow</span></a>.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Legend and fact soon become interchangeable in the lives of the Exalted, and the Solars embody this principle—to the degree that the Princes of the Earth sometimes find it necessary to hide even from themselves. This Charm allows the character to walk directly out of the ongoing narrative of his life, either dimming himself to the eyes of history, or increasing interest in his legend until he himself is all but forgotten.</p>
<p>Should the Solar dim himself, he passes from the active thoughts of Creation. His personal acquaintances will still recognize him, but strangers will not. Even if the Solar stands directly next to a poster bearing his face and name, those without a personal relationship simply will not connect the two. The Lawgivers use this Charm to temporarily escape from the public eye. This unnatural mental influence costs four points of Willpower to resist, or only one if someone actively points out the Solar&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Alternately, the Solar may enhance his glory until its glare blinds the world. The Lawgiver once again cannot be recognized as himself—even by those who know him. The reality of the man simply does not connect to the stature of his legend. Used in this mode, the Charm requires only two points of Willpower to resist, but offers an additional benefit: No action the Solar takes will besmirch his reputation, as bystanders are overcome by memories of the Exalt&rsquo;s glory days rather than circulating news of his misbehavior. For example, Desus could beat an orphan to death in the middle of the street, and any onlookers who recognized him would go home to reminisce about the time he bravely taught the behemoth Oliphem the cost of defying the Solar Deliberative. This unnatural mental influence costs three points of Willpower to resist.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar&rsquo;s Evidence-Discerning Method is permanently enhanced, strengthening the connection to those she has profiled. The Charm&rsquo;s Duration becomes Instant; profiles no longer require committed Essence to grant a mechanical benefit. A profile remains valid until the subject&rsquo;s Motivation or Virtues permanently change (temporary changes brought about by magic will not spoil a profile).</p>
<p>At Essence 5+, the Solar may roll (Wits + Investigation) one month before an individual he has profiled is planning to undertake any sort of premeditated larcenous enterprise (examples might include robbing a bank, staging a kidnapping, attempting an assassination, or, in the case of the Yozis, escap ing from Hell). This roll has a difficulty of half the subject&rsquo;s (Intelligence + Larceny), rounded down. Success grants the Solar an idea of what the subject plans to do, including at least the general location, and nature of the crime. Examples include:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid Magister is planning to illegally experiment on hun souls within a private, hidden manse on the Blessed Isle,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Ebon Dragon is going to try to break out of Hell with the assistance of a Yozi cult in Denandsor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tammuz is going to attempt to murder his Solar Mate aboard a pleasure yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Investigation 6+, Essence 6+ the Lawgiver may also make this roll to realize from subtle context clues whenever a profiled subject comes within (Investigation x 10) miles of him. The Solar may also anticipate non-premeditated larcenous actions at this level, though he suffers a -3 external penalty on attempts to do so.</p>

            <p>The Solar&rsquo;s defense must hold at all costs. If the Solar falls, so does all that she holds dear. From this grim resolution a Solar draws the power to survive all onslaught. The character may use this Charm in response to an attack that incurs pre-soak damage. Upon activation, his hardness to rises to a level equal to the pre soak damage of the attack. This does not prevent damage dice from being rolled, but rather guarantees that all lesser attacks are turned harmlessly aside. The Solar&rsquo;s hardness remains at this level for three actions, or until he is struck by an attack that overcomes his hardness. Should the Solar suffer such an attack, he may reflexively pay six motes to drive his hardness up to match the attack&rsquo;s raw damage. This does not count as a Charm activation. This renewed defense will last for three actions or until it is dispelled by a greater attack, whichever comes first. This Charm is ineffective against attacks the Solar permitted to be inflicted upon himself.</p>

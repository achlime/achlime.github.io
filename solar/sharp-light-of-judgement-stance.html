        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar whirls into a devastating attack, felling all who would stand against her with a storm of slashes. The character makes a standard Melee attack and applies it against all enemies within (Melee x 100) yards. Allies are immune to this onslaught; the waves of lethal radiance dance deftly past them. This attack is also applied against any enemy who moves into the effect radius during the Charm&rsquo;s duration, and applied again once per tick against any enemy attempting to move toward the Lawgiver. The attack produced by this Charm deals aggravated damage to creatures of darkness.</p>
<p>If used over consecutive actions, the Charm loses its Willpower cost after the first use, and cumulatively lowers its mote cost by two on each subsequent activation, to a minimum cost of 5m. The range of its area of destruction doubles with each consecutive activation. The Charm cannot spread to encompass more than the Solar&rsquo;s (Essence x 3) miles.</p>
<p>Directed against a complementary unit in mass combat, this Charm renders the attack unblockable and undodgeable, and multiplies its final damage in Step 10 by the Lawgiver&rsquo;s Essence.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Symphony of the Flayed Legion (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/ebon-lightning-prana.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Ebon Lightning Prana'"><span class="link-focus">Ebon Lightning Prana</span></a>). Gathering shadows about his weapon, the Abyssal casts shrieking waves of razoredged darkness across the battlefield. This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart, save that it lacks a Holy effect; instead, mortals slain by this Charm automatically rise one day later as uncontrolled zombies, full of risen hunger for the flesh of the living. This effect fails automatically in the face of any magic designed to prevent a corpse&rsquo;s reanimation.</p>

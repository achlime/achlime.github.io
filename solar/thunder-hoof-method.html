        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Sometimes riding down a foe is just not good enough. Points are best when made soundly. The Solar may pay five motes and one Willpower to concentrate all the incredible speed of his mount into a single instance of acceleration. For the space of a heartbeat, the Solar &lsquo;draws back the reins,&rsquo; holding his mount in place as a surge of withheld speed gathers in its legs like a storm, briefly drawing the world around horse and rider into the vacuum so created. When the Lawgiver lets go, all that force is unleashed in one tremendous shockwave that tears loose from the point of launch, ripping away at the ground with a sonic boom that inflicts automatic knockdown on all individuals within (Solar&rsquo;s Essence x 5) yards, while the mount is propelled forward (Essence x 10) yards in an instant. Creatures of darkness may not rise from prone until their DV has refreshed twice. This Charm may not be used more than once per action. For a point of reference, this Charm simply causes a sonic boom in the air, while in loose dirt or mud it may cause the added abuse of showering foes with muck; used over water, such as at dockside, it creates a small tsunami to achieve this effect.</p>

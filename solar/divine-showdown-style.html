        <div class="topic-text">
          <p>The world stills for a moment as the Solar gunslinger
locks eyes with a foe. His fighting spirit redoubles as
he calls his foe out with a shouted taunt, a menacing
gesture, or a dramatic gun cock. From that moment on,
the fight is between them alone. Divine Showdown Style
grants the Solar an Overdrive pool with a capacity of
ten motes. It can be activated to issue a challenge to any
enemy who is a heroic character. The challenge has the
following effects:<br><br>


<li>The Solar gains a single offensive mote each time he
damages the chosen enemy with a Firearms attack.</li>
			  <li>On any tick in which the Solar is attacked by enemies
other than the one he challenged, he gains a single
offensive mote.</li>
<li>If the challenged enemy falls Incapacitated or retreats
from the scene of combat, the Solar gains offensive motes
equal to their (Essence), and this Charm ends. It cannot
be reactivated for the rest of the scene.</li>
<li>The Solar loses a single offensive mote any time he
attacks a character other than the challenged enemy, unless
they attacked him on their last action.</li>
<li>He also loses an offensive mote each time one of his
allies attacks the challenged enemy.</li>
<li>The Solar cannot willingly end the duration of this
Charm.</li></p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Solars of the Dawn Caste are the ultimate warriors, allowing an uncanny instinct for battle to inform their every action. Infusing his battle arts with Essence, the Solar&rsquo;s comprehension of combat becomes holistic; his knowledge of an arrow&rsquo;s proper trajectory may guide the path of his sword, and the instinct that turns his fist into a deadly weapon will continue to serve him when guiding knives into the vitals of his enemies. By paying one mote and one Willpower, the Solar raises his ratings in Archery, Martial Arts, Melee, Thrown and War to the value of the highest rating among any of those five Abilities until his DV refreshes. This is considered a natural increase—for example, if the Solar had Dexterity 5, Melee 5, and Archery 1, he would be considered to have Archery 5, and would be able to add up to ten dice to his Dexterity + Archery dice pools. Moreover, the Solar may use the First, Second, or Third Excellencies of his highest-rated Ability to enhance any of those five Abilities until his DV refreshes.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Manifold Murder Arts (Prerequisite: <a class="complex" href="elegant-dance-of-bow-and-blade.html" title="mirror entry of charm 'Elegant Dance of Bow and Blade'"><span class="link-focus">Ever-Ready Killer’s Tools</span></a>). This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

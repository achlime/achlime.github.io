            <p>The Lawgivers know those they love and those they have sworn to protect. No wicked treachery may deceive a Solar who has learned this Charm, for he sees with his heart as much as his eyes. The Solar automatically sees through any disguise, Illusion or other effect that would allow a being to falsely masquerade as a character the Lawgiver harbors a positive Intimacy for. He likewise knows any free-standing illusions or hallucinations which attempt to depict such characters for the vile falsehoods they are. This Charm does not cause the Solar to know the true identity of a character wearing such a false seeming—it only makes the attempted deception apparent to him. This Charm applies (Solar&rsquo;s Awareness) automatic successes to any effect-conflict roll-off.</p>

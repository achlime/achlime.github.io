        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Sensing the pulse of Essence along which an attack was fired, a Lawgiver may send a strike back at his opponent with perfect form and blazing speed. This Charm allows the Solar to respond to an attack with a Melee attack of his own. This attack has infinite range, ignores cover, and may be made even if the Solar is unable to see his target. If assailed by a ranged weapon, the source of the attack is rent by a razor-edged heat shimmer of Essence at his location. At Essence 6+ the Solar may use Blind Impulse Strike in response to social attacks he is aware of, so long as they occur within the same realm of existence. At Essence 7+ the Solar may use this Charm to respond to all social attacks, regardless of where the perpetrator is. Blind Impulse Strike may only be activated once in response to a written social attack, no matter how many times the Solar re-reads it.</p>

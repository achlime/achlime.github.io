            <p>When the Primordials once uprooted mountains and cast them down against the armies of the gods. The Solar Exalted, embarrassed by such clumsy efforts, learned to absent themselves from the paths of these excessive demonstrations. A character who has learned this Charm may pay a four mote surcharge when invoking Seven Shadow Evasion to avoid an attack which inflicts damage on everything within an area (such as Lambent Bolt of Annihilation). The Solar&rsquo;s dodge deposits her at the nearest safe edge of the damage effect, if that location is within (Essence x 50) yards; walls and other obstacles are no impediment to this evasion. She may also carry out any consenting characters she is protecting with Defend Other actions at the time of activation. At Dodge 6+, Essence 6+ this restriction disappears, and the Solar&rsquo;s leaping dodges will carry her as far as necessary to remove her from the effect.</p>

Mocking laughter marks the Abyssal&rsquo;s relocation away from the area of effect. This Charm is otherwise identical to its Solar counterpart.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Reality itself bows to the prowess of the Solar Exalted when they act in accordance with the power infusing their Exaltation. All of the Solar&rsquo;s stunts are upgraded by one category (to a maximum of being three-point stunts) when the Lawgiver&rsquo;s actions reinforce her role as a god-king. Specifically, the Solar&rsquo;s actions must involve: ruling over or protecting those less powerful than herself; administrating territory or resources she owns; educating others; spreading either the worship of the Unconquered Sun or herself; or combating creatures of darkness. Successful stunts that are upgraded from two to three points by this Charm are not elligible to draw a point of experience as a reward. Natural three point stunts, rather than being upgraded, add automatic successes rather than dice. If a stunt has already been upgraded due to resonance with the Solar&rsquo;s Motivation, Lion&rsquo;s Roar Recovery provides no benefit.</p>
<p><strong>New Abyssal Charm</strong>: Underworld Executioner Stance. (Prerequisite: <a class="complex" href="../abyssal/faithful-killers-reprieve.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Faithful Killer’s Reprieve'"><span class="link-focus">Faithful Killer’s Reprieve</span></a>.) This Charm works like its Solar counterpart, except that rather than acting as a god-king, the Abyssal must play out her part as a world-killing weapon. Stunts are upgraded only when the Abyssal seeks to slay either the living or the dead, inflict needless cruelty upon another (mentally, emotionally or physically), inspire fear, or ruin Creation (salting fields, burning homes, poisoning rivers, orchestrating massacres to expand shadowlands, and so forth). Additionally, embracing this Charm raises the Abyssal&rsquo;s value in the eyes of the Neverborn above all other servants of Oblivion; hope is kindled in their dead hearts that the Abyssal may finally be the one to end even the Underworld, setting them free. As a result, the Exalt no longer accumulates Resonance for fighting spectres, Nephwracks, Deathlords or any other other creatures of death. This Charm cannot be learned by the Deathlords.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The heroes of the First Age used Ghost-Eating Technique to slay the Neverborn and the demon hordes. Spirits normally dissipate rather than dying when they lose all of their health levels to damage. The Solar invokes this Charm after making a successful attack that damages or dissipates a spirit. In addition to the normal damage from this attack, this Charm transfers a number of motes from the spirit to the Solar equal to (the Solar&rsquo;s permanent Essence x 2). If the spirit loses its last health level to this attack and dissipates, this Charm consumes the spirit utterly. Its Essence dissolves, and it will never be remade.</p>
<p>This Charm cannot drain more motes from a spirit than the total levels of damage dealt by the attack. Motes drained do not go into the Solar&rsquo;s Essence pool; rather, these torn-off fragments of spiritual power swirl invisibly about her, empowering her to continue her assault upon unruly spirits. For each mote drained by this Charm, the Solar may launch one Spirit-Cutting Attack at no mote cost. Phantasmal images of those spirits damaged or destroyed by Ghost-Eating Technique during the scene flicker and churn within the Solar&rsquo;s anima until she has used up all the captured Essence on Spirit-Cutting Attacks, or until the end of the scene, at which point the drained power dissipates.</p>

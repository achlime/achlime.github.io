        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The superior detective is aware that the physiognomy of a subject may reveal that subject&rsquo;s history. The Lawgiver knows this and more, for he may see into souls. The character makes a quick study of a subject, allowing him to see his target&rsquo;s genetic inheritance so acutely that he may discern their ethnicity and even the bloodline from which they arose—commensurate with his Lore rating. The character&rsquo;s discernment of heredity is so keen that he can tell which gente&rsquo;s bloodline a Terrestrial descends from at a glance.</p>
<p>As the Lawgiver grows in experience, so does this Charm&rsquo;s capabilities. At Investigation 5+, Essence 5+, the Solar catches physiognomic cues more readily; he can know if people are genetically related just by looking at them, and in what manner; or what a Dragon-Blooded target&rsquo;s Breeding is and exactly who the Terrestrial is descended from. The Lawgiver is also able to see into spirits; by glancing into a person&rsquo;s eyes or speaking to them for any length of time, the Lawgiver can see who they were in their former life.</p>
<p>At Investigation 6+, Essence 6+, the Solar need only look at someone while using this Charm to see directly into their soul: the Exalt can see his target&rsquo;s past 10 incarnations. By using Legacy-Detecting Glance at this level while speaking with Celestial Exalted, the character&rsquo;s past life memories begin to resonate with the Exaltation before him, discerning the previous bearer of the subject&rsquo;s Exaltation. If the Lawgiver were to handle an Exaltation in Lytek&rsquo;s office directly while using this Charm, he could discern the identity of every person to have contained that Exaltation. At Investigation 7+, Essence 7+, the Lawgiver can use this Charm to see directly into a targeted Chosen&rsquo;s Exaltation and discern all of the bearer&rsquo;s past incarnations; alternately, he may examine the subject&rsquo;s soul and witness its last 100 incarnations. At Investigation 8+, Essence 8+ the Solar may examine a subject&rsquo;s soul and trace its reincarnation history all the way to the beginning.</p>
<p>When activating this Charm, the Solar may choose to look into the genetic, mimetic, or Exalted history of his subject, but not all three at once.</p>
<p>The benefits of this Charm extend beyond genealogical trivia. If the Solar knows <a class="complex" href="evidence-discerning-method.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Evidence-Discerning Method'"><span class="link-focus">Evidence-Discerning Method</span></a> and has ever used it to profile any previous incarnation of the subject&rsquo;s soul or Exaltation, he automatically recovers that profile and may employ Evidence-Discerning Method against the subject for a cost of 1m.</p>

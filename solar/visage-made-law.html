        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Upon learning this Charm, the Solar impresses his identity upon the very fabric of the cosmos. The shinma open eyes they do not possess and behold the Exalt&rsquo;s face. They know him then, and will accept no substitutes.</p>
<p>Henceforth, all attempts to impersonate the Lawgiver suffer a -2 external penalty, and any character doing so suffers a three mote surcharge on the cost of all Charms while masquerading as the Solar. The motes spent to satisfy this surcharge are tithed to the Solar, delivered when he next awakens from at least one hour of uninterrupted sleep. The Solar may voluntarily exempt specific individuals from this cost and penalty, if he desires, and may just as easily revoke such exemptions. Additionally, whenever another individuals wears his face (either by magic or mundane disguise) that fact becomes Obvious to the Lawgiver when he next awakens—though the location, identity, and goal of the imposter are not revealed.</p>
<p>Finally, no effect may draw motes out of the Solar&rsquo;s Essence pool without his consent, and no form of magical mental influence may force him to give such consent.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Solars graciously accepted the surrender of the vanquished Primordials, they gained authority over their numerous souls and mimetic races, including the power to summon and bind them into service. Sometimes waiting for Calibration—or even sundown—is an affront to the Lawgivers, as if to mock them for the mercies they once accorded. This Charm enhances the spells Demon of the First Circle and Demon of the Second Circle. At Essence 7+, this Charm&rsquo;s power expands to encompass Demons of the Third Circle as well. When casting one of these spells, the Solar may spend an extra 10 motes and one Willpower to gain the following benefits: The casting time of the spell is reduced to a single hour, and the dramatic action used to shape this spell may begin at any hour of the day and on any day of the year. The concentrated power of the Solar&rsquo;s will visibly strains the boundaries of existence, causing a localized Calibration more ominous and bizarre than the natural fixing of Creation that marks the beginning and end of each year. For an area of (100 yards for a First Circle demon, 500 for Second Circle demon, and one mile for a Third Circle demon) around her, sunlight bleeds away as surely as the coming of midnight, and sounds somewhere between great hollow wails of torment and the grating of brass echoes out from her location. The Bureau of Destiny is made explicitly aware every time this Charm is used to enhance a summoning, and knows where it was used.</p>
<p>Whenever this Charm is used to summon a demon of the Third Circle outside of Calibration, the Solar must reflexively make a contested roll of his (Intelligence + Occult) against the Dodge MDV of each Third Circle demon he has currently bound. Failing this roll for a single demon permits all currently bound demons to slip free of their bindings.</p>

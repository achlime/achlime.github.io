        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In the First Age, the Solar Exalted used this Charm to steal the artifacts of the Fair Folk and the Yozis then turn them to the service of Creation. This Charm is an attempt to steal something in plain sight, within (the Solar&rsquo;s Essence) yards. The character must be able to carry the item, and the character cannot steal things in active use—again, including attuned artifacts—unless he is stealing from an extra&rsquo;s person. The character automatically succeeds in stealing the item. If another Charm contests this effect, add the character&rsquo;s Essence in automatic successes to the ([Dexterity or Wits] + Larceny) roll to oppose the other Charm.</p>
<p>Characters using ordinary senses cannot spot the theft with Awareness. Nor may they notice the theft afterward, until the Solar has refreshed his DV a number of times equal to his Essence score, barring unusual circumstances such as an attempt to use the item or the collapse of an arch after the character steals its keystone. Even players of characters with inhuman sensory acuity have a +4 difficulty on the opposed roll to notice the theft and a +8 difficulty on the unopposed roll to notice the item&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>This Charm normally costs five motes. To steal an item that he could not reach—on the other side of a window, outside of the character&rsquo;s cell, at the bottom of a narrow crevice and so forth—the character must also spend 1 Willpower.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This legendary Charm was employed only rarely in the First Age, as a reward for the most loyal of a Solar&rsquo;s mortal retinue, or to preserve a favorite servant or lover. It involves a complex, delicate 12-hour medical procedure that resets the Essence flows of the target&rsquo;s body and mends instabilities of the flesh. At the end of the process, the target is physically returned to the flower of youth—18 years of age for humans, or the proportional equivalent for animals. The target retains all memories and skills. This procedure is efficacious only when used on behalf of mortals or animals, and it wears off after a year and a day, returning the target to his previous age unless the Solar chooses to renew the Charm&rsquo;s application with another 12-hour procedure. Alternatively, the Lawgiver&rsquo;s player may choose to spend one experience point in addition to the standard cost of the Charm, removing the need for upkeep. The target will then begin to age normally from the point of his &ldquo;reset&rdquo; youth.</p>
<p>At Medicine 10, Essence 10, the experience point cost for enduring youth disappears. The Solar is still capable, though, of performing the Charm so that the target requires yearly maintenance.</p>

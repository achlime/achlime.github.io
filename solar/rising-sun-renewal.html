        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Perfection is the nature of the Solar Exalted, and the best efforts of the world cannot draw them away from that state for long. The Solar&rsquo;s Essence surges and begins to catalyze, producing a crackling, charged feeling in the air around her, as though a storm were about to commence. Once her DV has refreshed five times, she erupts into a torrent of blue-white Essence, shining like a newborn star. When this surge of power passes, the Solar stands unmarred—all her health restored. Activating a Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability at any point during the Charm&rsquo;s &lsquo;charging&rsquo; period resets its countdown. For example, if a Solar used Rising Sun Renewal, had her DV refresh three times, and then activated Heavenly Guardian Defense, she would need to wait until her DV refreshed five more times before her health levels would be restored. Losing more health levels than the Lawgiver&rsquo;s Stamina during the course of a single action delays the countdown by one DV refresh.</p>
<p>At Resistance 6+, Essence 6+, this Charm will also remove all Crippling effects in addition to healing the character.</p>

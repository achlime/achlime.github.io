        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>As the savant of the Sun excels at every aspect of life she excels at giving pleasure. Her touch sets nerves alight and fans pleasant tactile sensations into ecstatic eruptions. Sex becomes almost unbearingly pleasant as the subject transcends normal physical limitations and is brought to ecstatic heights that can only be attained with the most expensive drugs. There is a price pay for such enjoyment though—fatigue and pain at best, addiction at worst.</p>
<p>During the sexual act the subject can ignore negative effects from wounds, fatigue, derangements, fear and such. He is at a difficulty equal to the Solar’s Essence to focusing on anything other than pleasure as well as ending the act prematurely.</p>
<p>If the subject is brought to climax, which can be within minutes for those physically and mentally weak, a number of bashing health levels in inflicted on him equal to the Solar’s Essence, soakable only by his Natural Soak. The Solar’s player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) and adding her Essence in bonus dice, against the target’s MDV.</p>
<p>If the Solar succeeds, this Charm exerts unnatural mental influence and creates a Compulsion effect. The target becomes addicted and continuously lusts after the Solar. This effect costs two Willpower per day to resist. This effect does not depend on gender or sexual preference. This unnatural lust is a temporary Intimacy, and lasts until the Charm ends.</p>
<p>If the subject successfully resists addiction directly after the sexual act and isn’t already addicted, he regains one Willpower point and can for one day ignore any eventual wound penalties for the wounds inflicted by this Charm.</p>

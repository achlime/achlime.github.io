        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm offers a permanent upgrade to Crashing Wave Throw, allowing the Charm to throw victims an additional (Martial Arts x 10) yards upward and (Martial Arts x 20) yards horizontally. In addition to this benefit, by paying an additional five motes upon activating Crashing Wave Throw, the character may further enhance the effect of the Charm. The Solar violently swings his victim through the air until they blaze like the aura of a re-entry. Charged by the Solar&rsquo;s wrathful judgment, the victim is turned into a missile upon release, and may be aimed at further targets of the Lawgiver&rsquo;s animosity. In addition to the normal effects of Crashing Wave Throw, where the victim lands, the blazing Essence of the Solar&rsquo;s wrath detonates like a bomb: the victim and all other unfortunates within (Solar&rsquo;s Essence x 2) yards are subjected to a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage 10L, Trauma 3. This damage is multiplied by five against objects and structures. The Solar&rsquo;s killing intent fuels this Charm&rsquo;s explosive effect, and so it may not be used to turn willing allies with perfect soak effects into impromptu artillery, nor may it be used on objects or inanimate corpses. It also may not be used on extras.</p>

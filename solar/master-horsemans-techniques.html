            <p>The Chosen of the Sun know their animals well. This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt&rsquo;s capabilities with one of the following tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harmony of Spirits Style. The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to stop himself from falling off a mount. Characters can activate this effect when the character is inactive (see p. 143). In addition, as a permanent benefit, the character will not fall off the mount simply from being inactive during ordinary travel.</li>
<li>Horse-Summoning Whistle. The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to call a mount loyal to him to his side. The mount makes its way to him as circumstances best allow.</li>
<li>Master Horseman&rsquo;s Eye. The Solar can spend one mote reflexively when evaluating a mount and perfectly recognize its strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Speed-Sustaining Technique. The Solar can spend one mote reflexively and touch a mount to sustain it for two hours. Effort during that time does not exhaust the creature, and it does not suffer harmful random incidents such as thrown shoes or injured hooves.</li>
<li>Spirit-Steadying Assurances. The Solar can spend three motes reflexively to prevent a mount from panicking. The mount will not panic for the remainder of the scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters with this Charm can purchase additional tricks from this list for two experience points or one bonus point. Using these abilities does not count as a Charm invocation—this Charm permanently enhances the Exalt&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In the Time of Glory the Solars used this Charm to pull down the sky and drop mountains on the heads of the Primordials. In the Era of Dreams, a Solar once saved a caravan stranded in the desert after a Fair Folk attack by using Sun-Towing Method to haul their entire wagon train to Chiaroscuro with a single horse. Essence imbues the Lawgiver&rsquo;s mount with incredible strength to pull massive loads, incidentally also rendering any means used to attach the load (such as a rope tied off to a mount&rsquo;s saddle) unbreakable. The Solar&rsquo;s mount may pull any object with no loss of speed, regardless of the object&rsquo;s weight. This does not imbue the object with any unusual durability.</p>
<p>At Ride 6+, Essence 6+ Sun-Towing Method may be used to drag any vehicle, regardless of its size—even those normally large enough to qualify as structures, such as ships.</p>
<p>At Ride 7+, Essence 7+ the Solar may haul structures with a spherical mass up to up to (Essence x 50) yards in diameter. Should he tie off to a larger structure or landscape feature, his horse will tear out an appropriately-sized chunk and drag it away. For example, a Solar with Ride 10, Essence 10 could tear off the peak of a mountain and ride away with it at full gallop. Manses cannot be moved in this fashion.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The challenges of the Chosen of the Sun are many, and the Chosen meet them all with shining confidence. Yet sometimes, even the Chosen need some assistance. If the Solar is called upon to interview all people at the market, to negotiate with all bureaucrats in the palace, or is expected to simultaneously meet with the many ladies of the court, this Charm supplements the social activity undertaken by the Solar.</p>
<p>At a cost of 1m per mirage, the Charm can create up to (Essence x 5) mirages from the Solar&rsquo;s own Esence. The mirages persist for the duration of the Charm, and can move freely within (Essence x 100) yards of the Solar. The Charm ends when the activity ends or is interrupted. With respect to the action the images are created for, it is as if the Solar himself is present in multiple locations. The mirages are not capable of taking up other activities, but the Solar has complete control over the mirages within the bounds of the activity.</p>
<p>The Solar is aware and can experience all that the mirages he can observe directly experience. Should the Solar want to retain the memories of mirages that are not observed by him, he can have them make their way back to him to be re-absorbed at the end of the activity.</p>
<p>At the Solar&rsquo;s choice the mirages are either exact likenesses of the Solar, requiring a difficulty 3 (Perception + Awareness) toll to discern that they are illusions, or they can be shimmering golden phantasms, providing a clear display of the powers of the Chosen of the Sun.</p>
<p>This Charm is explicitly allowed to supplement actions with other abilities.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Solar fires his weapon into the air, magnifying the sound of the gunshot through his anima until it is as the terrifying roar of thunder. The Solar rolls (Charisma+ Performance) as an unblockable social attack against
all enemies within the base Range of his weapon, adding
automatic successes equal to his (Firearms) rating. Any
character whose MDV is exceeded by the roll succumbs to
an unnatural Emotion of fear, forcing them to spend the
rest of the scene fleeing from the Solar. On every tick, they
must take a Move action to move as far away as possible
from him, although they are never forced to move through
an area that would cause harm to them (such as a bonfire
or off a cliff). Affected characters can still take other actions
normally.<br><br>
Resisting this unnatural mental influence costs three
Willpower. Once a character has run outside the base Range
of the Solar’s firearm, he may pay one point of Willpower
for partial resistance, allowing him to stop running as long
as he remains outside that weapon’s Range. Extras and wild
animals are unable to resist this influence.</p>

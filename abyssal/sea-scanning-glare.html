        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The sea holds many dangers, especially for champions of Oblivion. Prudent captains keep a close eye on the waves and horizon, watching for any trace of an enemy&rsquo;s approach. An Abyssal can activate this Charm only aboard a ship he owns; it ends when he leaves the ship for any reason. While active, the Exalt ignores all visibility limitations or other penalties that would inhibit his ability to navigate. He also becomes preternaturally aware of his environment out to a distance of (Sail x 10) miles.</p>
<p>Through this Charm&rsquo;s awareness, the Exalt perfectly understands all weather conditions and mentally maps all terrain that is not magically obscured from scrying. He can spot reefs and other hazards long before they threaten his ship, not to mention noticing distant coasts before his lookouts do. His awareness lets him pinpoint other ships of seaworthy size. He also senses comparably large animals such as whales and siaka unless they are magically hidden in some way, though the Charm alone only reveals the size, speed and bearing of these objects. Used aboard an aerial vessel, this Charm maps terrain and tracks other aerial vehicles or animals of suitable size.</p>
<p><strong>New Solar Charm</strong>: Oceanic Omniscience Intuition (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="../solar/any-ability-excellency.html" title="interpolation entry of charm placeholder 'Any (Ability) Excellency'"><span class="link-focus">Any Sail Excellency</span></a>, <a class="complex" href="../solar/salty-dog-method.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Salty Dog Method'"><span class="link-focus">Salty Dog Method</span></a>). This Charm functions much like its Mirror, except it lacks the Avatar and Spectral keywords, and costs one additional Willpower point to activate.</p>

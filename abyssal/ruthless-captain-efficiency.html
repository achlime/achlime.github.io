        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Once an Abyssal masters this Charm, ships he command function at full efficiency and with no penalties, even with crew complements as low as a skeleton crew. In addition, each scene the deathknight spends commanding his crew counts as a scene of building an Intimacy of submissive fear in them unless they have an Essence rating equal to or greater than his own. Those who develop such Intimacies cannot take any actions that would knowingly result in harm to their captain or remove him from his position while aboard a ship he owns, unless they spend two Willpower points per day to overcome the unnatural mental influence of this Charm.</p>
<p><strong>New Solar Charm</strong>: Crew-Inspiring Charisma (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="../solar/salty-dog-method.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Salty Dog Method'"><span class="link-focus">Salty Dog Method</span></a>). The Solar Mirror to this Charm builds Intimacies of adoration to deter mutiny rather than terror, but otherwise operates the same way.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Abyssal blurs and fades into the darkness between the strands of the Tapestry, outside fate and completely invisible except to those who share her insight into the Neverborn&rsquo;s madness (i.e., those with a Whispers rating). This invisibility imposes a -2 external penalty to any attempt to notice or attack her. Ranged attacks against her become impossible (she is not a valid target) without the aid of magic or a stunt. The bonus adds two successes to contested Stealth rolls to avoid notice instead of adding to the onlooker&rsquo;s difficulty (such as when reestablishing surprise).</p>
<p>As an additional benefit, the Abyssal is outside fate for purposes of Sidereal astrology. While the Charm lasts, the deathknight cannot be found on the Loom of Fate, astrological blessings and curses do not affect her, and she sees through the false identities created through resplendent destinies.</p>
<p>It is still possible for the Abyssal to be detected, making effective Stealth rolls as important as ever. The fact that the Abyssal may use that Stealth even in the absence of cover or concealment, however, provides a significant tactical opportunity for repeatedly setting up unexpected attacks.</p>

            <p>The Abyssal grows jagged bone spurs on his knuckles or fingertips. The character is still considered unarmed, but he can parry ranged and lethal attacks without a stunt. The bone blades add +2 Accuracy and +5 Damage to her punches and clinches, which inflict lethal damage. They also gain the Overwhelming tag, with a minimum damage of two dice. The bonuses become part of the traits of the character&rsquo;s unarmed &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; and do not count as dice added by Charms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the protrusions impose a -3 internal penalty to Dexterity-based actions that require fine motor skills—including the use of weapons. This penalty is the Charm&rsquo;s primary Taint drawback for Abyssals who grow permanent weapons, not counting the obvious social implications for one&rsquo;s hands being covered in monstrous blades. Permanently acquiring such bone weapons costs the character four experience points or two bonus points at character creation.</p>
<p>If the Abyssal has Essence 4+, he may grow spikes and jagged skeletal protrusions from any part of his body to apply these same bonuses to any natural unarmed attacks. Doing so could include growing massive shark-like fangs when biting to regain Essence, extruding joint spurs for tackling and so on. Non-natural unarmed attacks do not receive this bonus, even for the form weapons of a martial art. As a Taint, such extreme body modification costs four bonus points or eight experience points.</p>

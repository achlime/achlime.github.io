        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Necrotic Essence permeates throughout the Abyssal&rsquo;s body, stripping away the weaknesses of living flesh. His skin hardens to living ivory, and his bones are as unbreakable steel. All attacks against the Abyssal have their minimum damage reduced by one die for the duration of this Charm unless they deal aggravated damage.</p>
<p>Against any attack that would reduce him to Incapacitated or worse while Wound-Eating Invulnerability is active, it prevents all damage that would go past his -4 health level, allowing him to shrug off even the most gruesomely fatal wounds. This desperate defense is Obvious, and ends the duration of this Charm prematurely. It can only trigger once per scene; subsequent incapacitating attacks will affect the Abyssal normally.</p>

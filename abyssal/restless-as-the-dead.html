        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Abyssal transcends the need for sleep and experiences reality as a particularly lucid nightmare. While this Charm is active, he suffers no adverse effects from sleep deprivation besides the lost opportunity for Willpower recovery. A character can use this Charm to go without sleep for (Stamina + Resistance) days. After that, he suffers one level of unsoakable bashing damage per day without sleep, which he must heal through rest before he can activate the Charm again.</p>
<p>An Abyssal can also make the Charm permanent as a Taint and never sleep again. He won&rsquo;t take damage, but he forever cuts himself off from the benefits of sleep. Doing so costs one bonus point or two experience points.</p>
<p><strong>New Solar Charm</strong>: Tireless Sentinel Technique (Prerequisites: None). This Charm works like its analogue, except that Solars cannot permanently abandon the need for sleep.</p>

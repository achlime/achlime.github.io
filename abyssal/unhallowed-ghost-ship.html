        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Abyssal captains brutalize their ships worse than they do their crew. This Charm grants ownership of any Sail-based vehicle that is not currently owned by another Essence user, infecting it with unholy Essence. As Unhallowed Ghost Ship activates, the ship&rsquo;s least god manifests on deck and screams in confused agony before the Charm permanently destroys her. Thereafter, the godless ship looks substantially more weathered and damaged than it really is. The ship imposes a -1 external penalty to all non-reflexive actions taken onboard by anyone who is not a creature of death. A ship cursed thus must always remain so. Without a god, it cannot have its ownership transferred. Wise enemies sink these vessels rather than invite catastrophe by attempting to capture them.</p>

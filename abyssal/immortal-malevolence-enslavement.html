        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>All Abyssals serve the Neverborn whether they intend to or not, but some embrace their destiny as world-killing weapons with a fervor that unnerves even the Deathlords. This Charm may be learned by only those deathknights who journey to the temple-tombs of their undead masters and prostrate themselves without interrupting their vigil for the time necessary to learn the Charm with a teacher. At the conclusion of this training period, the Neverborn judge the deathknight&rsquo;s heart. If any positive Intimacies remain, the Exalt suffers a 10-Resonance eruption and finds herself violently expelled from the unhallowed caverns in rebuke for troubling her sleeping masters.</p>
<p>Abyssals who come with truly desolate hearts watch as a new Monstrance of Celestial Portion grows out of her own flesh and forges a link to her Exaltation. Meanwhile, her old Monstrance implodes with a thunderclap, informing her liege that the deathknight no longer requires an intermediary to command her. The Deathlords dare not gainsay the revealed will of their masters, but the Exalt does lose the substantial benefits of any Liege dots she possessed. In exchange, she exists entirely outside Fate as a direct agent of the Neverborn and gains limited immortality.</p>
<p>Unless slain with an attack that can permanently destroy spirits, any lesser demise does not actually kill her. Instead, her body dissolves into tarry smoke that hisses one final retort. Following these parting comments, her Exaltation instantly returns to its Monstrance in the temple-tomb, leaving all possessions behind at the site of her death. Her body requires a day to regenerate within its cage, after which she awakens screaming in agony and with one less dot of Essence. The character temporarily loses access to all Charms whose minimum Essence exceeds her new rating until she spends the experience to regain her former Essence rating. (Immortal Malevolence Enslavement is an explicit exception to this rule.) Abyssals reduced to Essence 0 by this Charm fall into Oblivion.</p>
<p>In case it isn&rsquo;t obvious, this Charm disqualifies an Abyssal from ever redeeming herself and becoming a Solar again. From this decision, there is no return.</p>

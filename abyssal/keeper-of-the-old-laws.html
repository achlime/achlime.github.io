        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Abyssal becomes a warden of the Old Laws, gaining an infallible sense that informs him when an individual breaks an Old Law he has laid down with this Charm&rsquo;s prerequisite. He knows when and where the law has been broken, but not by whom. He enjoys one automatic success on all attempts to investigate the violation and determine the identity of the lawbreaker.</p>
<p>Should the Abyssal successfully uncover the lawbreaker and punish her, he loses one point of Resonance. Fitting punishment includes execution, destruction of a ghost&rsquo;s Fetters or the subject of one of its Passions, or sacrifice of a living individual&rsquo;s property to the dead sufficient to drop the individual a Resources dot (for example, if a wealthy merchant worth Resources 4 violated one of the Old Laws, the Abyssal might turn his fine home into a burnt offering to the merchant&rsquo;s ancestors, reducing the lawbreaker to Resources 3 and setting him off on the road with only his wagon and goods to attempt to rebuild his fortune).</p>

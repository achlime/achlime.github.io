        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Even as they steal lives for Oblivion, deathknights may steal weapons from their foes and turn them against their owners. An Abyssal may use this Charm against any weapon within (Essence x 8) yards. Items not wielded by their owner obey without hesitation and fly into the Abyssal&rsquo;s outstretched hand. Seizing a weapon from its owner&rsquo;s hand or a sheath on his person is more difficult, requiring an opposed reflexive roll of the Abyssal&rsquo;s (Manipulation + Melee) against the wielder&rsquo;s (Strength + Melee). If the deathknight wins, the weapon betrays its owner to join its new master, who becomes its new owner (<strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 238). If the owner wins, the weapon remains where it is and cannot be targeted by Thieving Raiton Claws for the rest of the scene. Thieving Raiton Claws cannot target attuned artifact weapons or weapons made entirely of Essence.</p>

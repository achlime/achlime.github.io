        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With greater depravity and force of will, Abyssals may impose permanent changes to the realms of the dead. This Charm improves its prerequisite with additional capabilities:</p>
<p><strong>Wealth:</strong> Unearthed grave goods may be given full solidity and immunity to sunlight by feeding slain beings into a fissure before disturbing its treasures. Such sacrifices conform to the Resources equivalent for prayer offerings as defined on p. 132 of <strong>Exalted</strong> and must have a value equal to or greater than the value of the goods the Abyssal wishes to take into Creation.</p>
<p><strong>Artifacts:</strong> If the Abyssal creates an artifact with Nightmare- Carving Murmur using materials imported from the shadowlands, it is fully solid and immune to sunlight. Such wonders are more difficult to create and cannot have their construction speeded by more than tenfold, though appropriate Craft Charms may supplement and speed the process as normal.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> The Exalt may alter a person or social unit in range with Nightmare-Carving Murmur, applying an external penalty equal to the target&rsquo;s Essence rating (for an individual creature of Death) or Dodge MDV (for all other targets). Success allows the Abyssal to change the target&rsquo;s Motivation to anything involving harm and impose a number of mutation points on all affected characters equal to the deathknight&rsquo;s Essence rating. These mutations must increase the target&rsquo;s suffering or its capacity to inflict suffering on others. A target may resist this change outright at a cost of four Willpower points, or two points to limit the possible scope of the change with a single condition approved by the Storyteller. If the Abyssal tries to shape social units, add the unit&rsquo;s Magnitude to the Essence or Dodge MDV of its leader, and the leader spends Loyalty to resist the changes.</p>
<p>Vision: If the Abyssal has Whispers 1+, he may shape areas of the Labyrinth at difficulty 1 whenever he alters it in fulfillment of the revealed will of the Neverborn shown to him in a Whispers vision.</p>
<p>Shaping the Labyrinth in response to the Whispers is the only use of this Charm that the Neverborn do not count as a grievous sin against Oblivion. The Abyssal gains two Resonance for every dice roll in the extended action, and suffers an immediate Resonance eruption when the act of creation ends, using all the accumulated Resonance.</p>

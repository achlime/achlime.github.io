        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>One disease, the Great Contagion, killed more people than all of Creation&rsquo;s wars put together. The Chosen of the Void can use the lethal power of disease. If the Abyssal can touch a living creature, she can expose that person or animal to any natural disease that she has ever imbibed through Plague-Eating Kiss. Doing so requires an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll at a difficulty one lower than the disease&rsquo;s Virulence. The target&rsquo;s player then rolls (Stamina + Resistance) against the disease&rsquo;s Virulence. The supernaturally induced disease behaves like the natural disease in every way, except it is not contagious.</p>
<p>When a character learns this Charm, she selects one natural disease (see Exalted, pp. 351–353) that she can induce. Characters can induce one additional disease at a cost of one experience point each, or two per bonus point spent on this Charm.</p>
<p>At Essence 4, Abyssals can learn to induce supernatural diseases such as Green Rage, White Sun Sickness (see The <strong>Manual of Exalted Power—The Lunars</strong>, pp. 212–213), Drunken Moth Sickness or Broken-Tile Organ Condition (see <strong>Scroll of the Monk</strong>, p. 125). These diseases all come from the first two circles of supernatural disease (defined in <strong>Scroll of the Monk</strong>, p. 154). At Essence 5, Abyssals can learn to induce Third Circle supernatural diseases, including a comparatively mild strain of the Great Contagion—it&rsquo;s actually treatable. Finding most supernatural diseases is left as a challenge to the deathknight. Some Deathlords, however, keep samples of the Great Contagion for their servants.</p>

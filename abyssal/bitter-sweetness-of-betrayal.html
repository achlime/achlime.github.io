        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Moonshadows liken the act of murder to a night with a cheap whore. It will do, but it lacks romance or meaning. The destruction of an enemy should involve the slow seduction of shattered dreams and broken hopes as foreplay to the final release of the killing blow. The Abyssal spends a scene interacting with the target or someone toward whom the target has a positive Intimacy. The deathknight&rsquo;s player rolls (Manipulation + Socialize), adding a number of bonus successes equal to the character&rsquo;s Essence rating and applying an external penalty equal to the target&rsquo;s Essence rating.</p>
<p>For as long as this Charm remains active, the target carries an unnatural Compulsion effect that reaches out to infect those toward whom he holds a positive Intimacy whenever he interacts with them. If the number of successes rolled for this Charm exceeds such a loved one&rsquo;s Dodge MDV, that character must betray the target at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Upon using this Charm, the Abyssal specifies whether it induces violent or nonviolent betrayal. In the former case, the betrayal takes the form of combat initiated with the best unexpected attack available to the character. The betrayer uses the most deadly attacks available to her and attacks without mercy. Nonviolent betrayal involves whatever course of action the target would find most emotionally hurtful and damaging to the target&rsquo;s Intimacy toward the attacker. In either case, loved ones may abort their treachery at any point and come to their senses by paying one Willpower point. The Illusion effect of this Charm, however, makes them believe their betrayal was entirely their own mad impulse unless they pay three Willpower points instead.</p>

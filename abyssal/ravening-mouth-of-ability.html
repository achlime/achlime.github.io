        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Touched by the endless hunger of Oblivion, Abyssal Exalted can learn to extend their animas through their mastery of a particular Ability, drinking Essence from the suffering they inflict. Whenever the deathknight takes an action or activates a Charm using the chosen Ability, he regains one mote for every level of damage the action or Charm inflicts to sentient beings as if he had bitten the victims directly. If multiple Ravening Mouth of (Ability) Charms could apply in a situation, the Abyssal may use only one. Indirect damage to that target also awards motes, such as health levels paid as part of the costs of defensive Charms. Ravening Mouth Charms exist for Archery, Martial Arts, Melee and Thrown. Abyssals cannot use this Charm to feed through the effects of spells.</p>
<p>Note that ongoing damage after the initial action or Charm (such as from poison) do not award further motes. In addition, the Abyssal can never gain more than 20 motes during a single one of her actions from any combination of Charms including Ravening Mouth of (Ability).</p>
<p>Any motes granted by this Charm are attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Abyssal&rsquo;s Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Abyssal may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</p>

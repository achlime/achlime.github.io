        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Sometimes the most instructive perspectives in life come from outside one&rsquo;s self. A deathknight may demonstrate the folly of a person&rsquo;s ways by showing her target the way in which the world sees him. The Abyssal must have a head-sized object carved with an effigy-face, such as a gourd or a pumpkin, and must have it to hand (prepared with a miscellaneous Draw/Ready weapon action) in order to use this Charm. The character makes a (Dexterity + Larceny) roll, opposed by the target&rsquo;s highest DV (Essence-users impose a -3 external penalty on this roll); should this attack succeed, the Abyssal quickly steals the target&rsquo;s head, replacing it with the prepared replacement. This does not kill the target. Instead, the victim may now see himself as the Abyssal does.</p>
<p>The effigy head of the victim becomes animate, capable of the simplest phrases and mannerisms. It knows all of the victim&rsquo;s Intimacies and has full control of the victim&rsquo;s body. Its Motivation is to subtly murder the target&rsquo;s positive Intimacies, starting with family and friends, by means of baroque betrayals, staged accidents, and the like, typically beginning with helpless loyalties such as pets. It does these things through seemingly oblique acts of cruelty extending from parodies of the victim&rsquo;s own shortcomings, like leaving a dangerous object at the top of the stairs where someone will likely trip and fall, or by placing sharp bones in a beloved pet&rsquo;s repast. Should the effigy work through all of the victim&rsquo;s Intimacies, or should the victim have no positive Intimacies to begin with, the thing moves off into the world to seek victims at random, with a preference for the weak and the unwitting. If confronted, the effigy attempts to flee rather than fight. The effigy is unable to make use of any of the victim&rsquo;s Essence-based powers, but uses their dice pools otherwise. Destroying the effigy-head renders the body comatose until its head is returned.</p>
<p>While in this condition, the victim&rsquo;s head may witness all the actions the effigy takes, and even speak to and be answered by the Abyssal, but no one else may hear him. The victim&rsquo;s severed head may use any Charms that might be beneficial in his reduced state (generally meaning social magic, Awareness Charms, and soak-boosting effects), and may make social attacks against the Abyssal, but can take no other actions of real consequence. Meanwhile, the effigy controlling his body appears to all who see it to be the victim. This unnatural Illusion is treated as a social attack accumulating ten automatic successes, which costs three points of Willpower to see through.</p>
<p>Unlike most Charms, the Abyssal may not voluntarily drop the mote commitment that sustains Malicious Parody Imposter so long as the victim&rsquo;s head is separated from his body. The Charm may end only when the Abyssal returns the victim&rsquo;s head to his body, or when the victim dies. Other characters may not return the victim&rsquo;s head to his body while the Abyssal lives; they must coerce or convince the deathknight to end his cruel lesson. If the Abyssal is dead, the victim&rsquo;s head may be reattached by any character who puts it back in its proper place.</p>

            <p>Though some of their brethren might find such practices distasteful, practical Abyssals may learn to renew themselves from even the crudest aspects of death. This Charm permanently alters the Abyssal&rsquo;s feeding capabilities (see <strong>The Manual of Exalted Power—The Abyssals</strong>, p. 95), permitting the deathknight to gain Essence by devouring inanimate human corpses. Devouring a single mote&rsquo;s worth of flesh requires a Speed 5, DV -2 miscellaneous action; only one such action may be placed in a flurry. Once the character has gained her (Stamina + Essence) motes in this manner she must wait a full day to digest before this limit resets and she may feed again. A relatively intact, adult cadaver is worth three motes of Essence, and usually runs dry of Essence long before the deathknight has consumed all of its flesh; as a result, most cadavers are still suitable for reanimation even after serving as fodder through this Charm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm allows the Abyssal to disguise his subject as a ghost. This disguise includes a forged identity with Underworld-based Influence equal to the Abyssal&rsquo;s Essence. Characters using Charms to examine a subject under the effect of Death Dealer&rsquo;s Chance conclude that he is a ghost (add the Abyssal&rsquo;s Larceny in extra dice to the roll-off). For most intents and purposes, the subject is a ghost: he respires Essence as a creature of death, is immaterial in Creation, tangible at night in shadowlands, and so forth. The target does not become a creature of darkness, nor are they subject to any effects that specifically act upon ghosts, such as the necromancy spell &ldquo;Summon Ghost.&rdquo; The subject gains no Arcanoi and may continue to use his own Essence-based powers, should he have any.</p>
<p>The subject must freely agree to have this Charm used upon him and may not be magically coerced into giving consent. Upon activation, the Abyssal begins a signature game of chance with the subject. Sometimes this Charm takes the form of a card game; other Abyssals prefer a series of riddles; others still roll dice, draw stones, or engage in challenges stranger still. The process varies from Exalt to Exalt, but always concludes in three stages. The subject rolls (Wits + a relevant Ability determined by the Storyteller) against a climbing difficulty in each game: difficulty 1 for the first game, 2 for the second, and 3 for the third. The Abyssal may not aid or hinder these rolls in any way. With each successive victory, the target feels himself changing. First his body grows numb and cold. Second, he begins to see the shadowy vapors of the dead (if ghosts are present) and hears the whispers of the Neverborn. Finally he is remade as a ghost and, if in Creation, dematerializes instantly. If, however, the target fails at any of these rolls, the results may be tragic: Exalts take (Abyssal&rsquo;s Essence) levels of unsoakable lethal damage, while mortals immediately perish. If the subject&rsquo;s nerve breaks and he abandons the games before the third roll is complete, he merely forfeits all Willpower. Should the Abyssal depart with the games unfinished, he instead suffers this fate.</p>
<p>The subject may end this disguise at any time by spending a point of Willpower and using a Speed 5, DV -2 miscellaneous action to tear away the gauzy Essence enshrouding him. The disguise otherwise dissipates at the rising of the next full moon, when Luna smiles to uncover the ruses of ghost and shadow. This occurs wherever the character may be.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Abyssal transcends vulnerability to maiming injuries. As long as the deathknight has sufficient cadaverous material anywhere within (Essence x 100) yards, this Charm violently rips assorted body parts into the air and pulls their shredded pieces into the Abyssal&rsquo;s wounds, assembling a prosthetic &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for a Crippling effect like one created with Bone Graft Technique. This implant requires no roll to build, however, and may be used immediately without a day of convalescence.</p>
<p>More gruesomely, this Charm can replace any number of existing implants or undamaged tissue in a single activation, in which case the rejected organs shred themselves into a cloud of gore and bone fragments before reassembling to fit the Abyssal&rsquo;s vision. A total redesign of a character&rsquo;s body adds an amount equal to his Essence rating to the difficulty of any rolls to recognize him as the person he used to look like. This does not aide in impersonation attempts and cannot alter a person&rsquo;s sex or other core structural aspects of his physiological identity. (For instance, the Abyssal can&rsquo;t make a sharkman look like a true human.) Height, weight and apparent age are fair game, allowing deathknights Exalted as children to overcome their inherent stasis when they feel they have outgrown their current body. The Appearance Attribute may be increased with appropriate alterations, bypassing the need for training time but costing normal experience.</p>

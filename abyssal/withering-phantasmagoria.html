        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm expands Haunting Apparition Trick. The maximum radius for evoking unnatural effects extends to (Essence x 100) yards, or (Essence – 5) miles if the Abyssal has Essence 6+. More importantly, the Exalt may use these effects to cause physical injury to living, mortal creatures within (Essence x 10) yards. The Charm causes harm through blatantly supernatural and suitably Abyssal effects. Chill winds freeze, frightful keening causes the victim to bleed from the ears and so on.</p>
<p>Withering Phantasmagoria inflicts harm in three ways. The Abyssal chooses between them each time she uses the Charm. Two methods last as long as the Abyssal continues to sing, play, orate or the like, and spends Essence each action to maintain the Charm. The third is an instant attack. For each form, however, the Abyssal&rsquo;s player must roll (Charisma + Performance) to initiate the attack. A character gains one attack form when she learns the Charm. Additional applications cost an additional experience point each, or all three attack forms for one bonus point. A character can use only one attack form at a time. Activating the Charm costs Willpower. Continuing it merely costs Essence (for the two continuing effects).</p>
<p><strong>New Solar Charm</strong>: Demon-Wracking Glory (Prerequisites: <a class="complex" href="../solar/phantom-conjuring-performance.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Phantom-Conjuring Performance'"><span class="link-focus">Phantom-Conjuring Performance</span></a>). This Charm expands the capabilities of Phantom-Conjuring Performance to increase its range. It also has the Holy keyword for its Performance-based attacks, inflicting aggravated damage to targeted creatures of darkness but leaving all other creatures unharmed. Attacks take the form of bright fires, scorching beams of sunlight, phantom executioners and the like.</p>

            <h4>Area, Continuing</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>The Abyssal inflicts one level of lethal damage per two motes spent each action, to a maximum of (Essence) damage. Targets can soak this damage only with Stamina or soak-enhancing Charms. The Abyssal&rsquo;s lethal performance affects everyone whose Dodge MDV is less than the number of successes from the attack roll. Continuing the attack counts as the character&rsquo;s Charm use for each action.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="single-target-continuing">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Single Target, Continuing</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>The Abyssal&rsquo;s chosen victim suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage per action that the Abyssal continues the Charm. This effect costs three motes per action. The initial attack roll must exceed the victim&rsquo;s Dodge MDV. Continuing the attack counts as the character&rsquo;s Charm use for each action.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="single-target-instant">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Single Target, Instant</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>The Abyssal spends up to her (Stamina + Essence) in motes and inflicts that many dice of lethal damage, plus extra successes from the attack roll. The target can resist this damage only with Stamina or soak-enhancing Charms. The attack cannot be parried without a Charm or stunt, but it can be dodged like a normal ranged attack.</p>

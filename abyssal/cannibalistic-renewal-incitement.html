        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With a touch, an Abyssal imparts some of his own monstrous hunger and consumptive Essence into a patient. For the duration of the Charm, the patient smells all other members of her own species as if they were the finest delicacies and idly imagines biting into them. This faint sensory distortion does not compel her to act on the impulses, but if she gives in to this hunger, she finds that the fresh blood or meat of her own kind sates her on a level that normal food cannot. Every three lethal health levels consumed heals one level of lethal damage or two levels of bashing damage. After the Charm ends, her senses return to normal. Exalted are considered humans for the purposes of this Charm and Abyssals may enchant themselves with Cannibalistic Renewal Incitement, though deathknights regain no motes from health levels consumed for healing purposes. Once a character heals a total of (her Stamina + Essence) health levels with all activations of this Charm, she must wait a full day to digest before this limit resets and she can feed again.</p>

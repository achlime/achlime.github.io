        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm enhances any Thrown attack so that it appears to graze its target with only superficial injury. If the attack hits, however, it applies one or more of the effects and all associated keywords listed here regardless of damage. The Abyssal learns one of these powers along with the initial purchase of Wicked Darts of Suffering and may broaden his repertoire by spending one experience point per power (or two for a bonus point).</p>
        </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="corrosion">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Corrosion</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>Eating into a target like acid, the attack inflicts double its raw damage against inanimate objects and inflicts minimum damage even if it fails to penetrate an object&rsquo;s Hardness. This power also unravels the Essence of Wyld creatures with similarly caustic and brutal results.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="destruction">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Destruction</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>The attack kills any mortal or natural animal extra it hits as a Shaping and Avatar (1) effect, typically inflicting death in a horrific manner incongruous to the attack itself. If the Abyssal has Essence 4+, the attack slays non-extras and spiritually wounds Essence-users by consuming a selected Virtue channel in addition to inflicting usual physical injuries.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="infection">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Infection</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>The attack automatically infects a living target as a Sickness effect rather than inflicting any actual damage, as if the target failed a Virulence check. The infection&rsquo;s Morbidity (treated and untreated) also starts at the Abyssal&rsquo;s Essence rating and increases normally. Mortal extras infected thus immediately succumb to fever and begin dying, though they can be saved normally with magical treatment.</p>
    </div>

                    <div class="topic topic--additional-effect" id="pain">
        <span class="runin-header">
            <h4>Pain</h4> (1xp):</span>
        <p>The attack inflicts excruciating pain to animate victims as a Crippling effect, doubling the raw damage of the attack and making that damage bashing. Victims add their Essence rating to their soak against this pain and cannot be reduced below Incapacitated from such an attack.</p>

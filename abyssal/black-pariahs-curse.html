        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Abyssal Exalted stand as gatekeepers between Creation and the Underworld. The deathknight can call upon this authority to make the living witnesses to the plight of the dead. To use this Charm on a character, the Abyssal must touch them. Cursed characters become attuned to the spiritual reality of the Underworld as a Shaping effect. They are capable of perceiving and interacting with dematerialized ghosts as though the dead were material—but by the same token, ghosts need not materialize to physically interact with them. In effect, the victim is simultaneously materialized and dematerialized, but only dematerialized with regard to ghosts and other things native to the Underworld (such as relic walls and weapons).</p>
<p>Repeated activations of this Charm can tag multiple targets, costing three motes per target (one mote per extra). Ghosts can perceive the curse on the pariah as an Obvious aura, realizing that he is capable of interacting with them. Whether they seek him out to beg favors, demand offerings or torment him ruthlessly depends on their temperament. Ghosts with an Intimacy towards the cursed character sense the curse going into effect and remain aware that the effects is in place on the specific target across all distance and realms of existence. This gives them a chance to plan a reunion with a lost love or vendetta on an old enemy. The Abyssal can use this Charm on himself if he wishes; it is only a curse for those he wishes to torment.</p>
<p>Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 4+ allows the deathknight to tag ghosts and other plasmic creatures of the Underworld for an increased cost of six motes. This doesn&rsquo;t function on ghosts with higher Essence than the Abyssal, such as the Deathlords. Touching the space such entities occupy is sufficient to deliver the curse when actual physical interaction is impossible (usually due to the ghost being incorporeal). Tagged ghosts exist simultaneously as materialized and dematerialized in all realms of existence, allowing them to perceive and physically interact with everything regardless of its material state. Ghosts matter less to the universe, and so they do not broadcast the curse&rsquo;s presence via the Intimacies of others. However, anyone who perceives them can sense the tag&rsquo;s effects as an Obvious effect.</p>

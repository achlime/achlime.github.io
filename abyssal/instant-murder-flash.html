        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Ash Child hones his blade into the vector of a thousand little deaths. The skill of his attacks may hold his victims in thrall. This Charm allows the Abyssal to create a flurry of attacks at his full dice pool directed at multiple opponents, with a total Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest values for any one attack. This attack ignores Rate. To activate this Charm, there must be one target within (Essence x 5) yards of the Abyssal, and a second target within that same distance from the first. The Abyssal vanishes into a black blur, scything through the body of his first target before moving on to the next. He may attack up to (Dexterity + 3) times in this fashion, moving up to (Essence x 5) yards between each attack to reach a new victim. Each attack must be directed at a separate target.</p>
<p>Whenever the Abyssal inflicts at least one health level of damage with one of these attacks, the target&rsquo;s soul is caught in an icy vacuum of relentless death, their life held in abeyance for the duration of the attack. The victim becomes temporarily Inactive for the duration of the tick on which he was struck, during which time he is completely helpless to defend himself. (This Inactive state has no Speed value and does not hasten or delay the victim&rsquo;s next action tick.)</p>
<p>The victim experiences a sensation much like dying; he sees only darkness, and feels nothing but the terror of an impending doom. This &ldquo;moment of death&rdquo; is reversed on the next tick: the character regains his consciousness and may resume acting. Note that his recovery is not a predestined byproduct of this Charm; his return to consciousness is fully dependent on him not being slaughtered on the tick in which he goes inactive.</p>
<p>Instant Murder Flash holds victims on the precipice of death by exposing them to the limitless scope of the deathknight&rsquo;s talent for killing. This thrall lasts only as long as the attack continues. If the Abyssal ends this attack prematurely, each victim immediately recovers from Inactive status. The Abyssal may not re-apply his damage via Charms or use free reflexive attacks on opponents made Inactive by Instant Murder Flash. Interrupting Instant Murder Flash for any reason terminates all suspension of its victims. This does not, however, prevent the Abyssal&rsquo;s allies from annihilating Inactive victims.</p>

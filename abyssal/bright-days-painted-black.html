        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When the Dragon-Blooded stormed the Calibration Banquet, unleashing blood and burning hell upon the stunned Lawgivers, the Sidereals thought they were saving Creation. But they may have created their worst enemy. The beast of the Usurpation stalks Creation, twisted by the murder that was done to him. All his memories of those halcyon days have been rent by the savage claws of a rough beast, transforming him into a living nightmare of Creation&rsquo;s past. This Charm grants the character an Overdrive pool with a capacity of fifteen motes. Initially empty, it may be filled under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Abyssal encounters the reincarnation of a Sidereal who participated in the Usurpation—</li>
<li>If the Abyssal encounters a Sidereal who participated in the Usurpation—</li>
<li>If the Abyssal encounters a Lunar who survived the Usurpation—</li>
<li>If the Abyssal encounters his Lunar mate—</li>
<li>If the Abyssal encounters a Solar or Infernal who was a member of his circle in a past life—</li>
</ul>
<p>—if any of these chance meetings should occur, roll the Abyssal&rsquo;s Willpower, regardless of whether the Exalt is aware of his past relationships to any of these characters. For every success on this roll, the Abyssal gains two offensive motes. For a gain of four motes or less, the Abyssal feels a welling up of terrible forces urging him to kill the character that has triggered his Overdrive. This may be accompanied by flashes of his death at the Usurpation braced by images of happier times, bloodstained and darkened by contrast.</p>
<p>This compulsion is not strong enough to force the deathknight&rsquo;s hand. However, if he gains six or more motes from this roll, the Abyssal&rsquo;s player must immediately roll Join Battle, as the Abyssal goes into a frenzy of relentless attack against the character that triggered his Overdrive. He may not retreat, nor may he resist attacking the target character. Once he has accepted six or more offensive motes from this Charm, either the deathknight or his victim&rsquo;s fate is sealed. The Abyssal gains one offensive mote per action under the effects of this Overdrive, and will not cease attacking until his target is dead or has fled the scene beyond his ability to follow. If the target escapes the Abyssal, the deathknight&rsquo;s murderous trance terminates at the end of the scene.</p>
<p>The roll for this Charm occurs the first time in any scene where the Exalt encounters a valid target. It may not be rolled more than once per scene. It will, however, trigger each and every time the Abyssal encounters the same valid target across multiple scenes.</p>
<p>The only way for the Abyssal to resist this Charm is to pay two Willpower before rolling. Doing so prevents the player from making the Willpower roll against a single trigger character for one week. However, if that character is present when the Abyssal&rsquo;s player rolls Join Battle for any reason, the Abyssal&rsquo;s player must also make the roll for this Overdrive, and if he accrues eight or more motes, the beast of the Usurpation is reborn, and the onslaught begins. During this time, the Abyssal may attack any other character but the one he wishes to spare, until all other opponents are incapacitated. For lack of any other targets, the Abyssal will invariably turn his attack upon the target of his Overdrive.</p>

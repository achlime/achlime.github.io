        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Is a defeated Abyssal actually dead? The Exalt gains a number of extra Incapacitated health levels equal to his current Stamina. In addition, his vital signs all but stop while he&rsquo;s Incapacitated, giving him benefits comparable to Plague Knows Its Master (see p. 149), Corpse Needs No Food and Breathless Ghost Emulation and making him appear dead to all examination. If a Charm opposes this effect, add the Abyssal&rsquo;s Essence rating in bonus successes to the contested roll. Deathknights cannot purchase this Charm more times than they have dots of Resistance.</p>
<p>Abyssals with Essence 3+ may suspend their vitals as a diceless miscellaneous action without actually reducing themselves to Incapacitated, though they become equally immobile and insensate. When entering this state, the Abyssal&rsquo;s player must specify what conditions will reflexively awaken the character, but any triggers other than a fixed passage of time must be events that the Abyssal could sense if he were awake.</p>

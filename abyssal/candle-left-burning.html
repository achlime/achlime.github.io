        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Death lurks in all mortal beings like a seed waiting to germinate. An Abyssal master of disease who does not wish to inadvertently slay useful pawns or valued allies with the horrors he unleashes may spare them with this Charm. Leaning close, the Abyssal breathes in a small fraction of the potential for death within a living being; this requires mouth-to-body contact, and is generally accomplished either through a bite or a kiss. So long as the Abyssal commits Essence to this Charm, the target becomes fully immune to one disease the Abyssal is capable of bestowing with Pestilence-Bearing Touch. An individual may be targeted by multiple activations of this Charm to immunize her to different diseases, and the Abyssal may also sustain the Charm&rsquo;s effects on multiple individuals at once, if he desires. Using this Charm on any living individual whose continued existence is not of direct material benefit to the Abyssal inflicts one point of Resonance.</p>
<p>Alternately, the Abyssal may activate this Charm on a character already harboring a disease he has inflicted with Pestilence-Bearing Touch. This immunizes the target against the disease&rsquo;s symptoms—they will not suffer or die from the ailment—but leaves them fully infected and contagious, capable of spreading their disease to the living while appearing hale and healthy. Attempts to diagnose a target whose symptoms have been devoured in this manner suffer a -3 external penalty. When the Abyssal releases the motes to committed to the Charm, the victim&rsquo;s symptoms will return in full. Using the Charm in this manner never grants Resonance.</p>

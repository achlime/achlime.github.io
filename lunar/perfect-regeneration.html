        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Not even the most sagacious Lunars suspect that some of their chimera foes are so dangerous because of centuries of experience, centuries often gained while the chimera was thought already to be dead. This Knack makes a chimera as close to immortal as anything in Creation besides a god or the Fair Folk.</p>
<p>The chimera&rsquo;s regeneration continues even after the creature is dead. Only burning every part of the corpse can release its Exaltation. If so much as a fingernail or even a few fresh drops of blood escape the fire, then the chimera slowly regenerates, bit by bit, until its reconstituted body returns to life. The chimera&rsquo;s Essence naturally collects in the largest remaining body part: splitting the chimera in two will not cause the body parts to create two chimerae. The amount of time this regeneration takes depends on how much of the body escaped destruction. As a guideline, a chimera whose corpse remains largely intact can return to life within a week, while one that must regenerate from a single drop of blood takes more than a year.</p>

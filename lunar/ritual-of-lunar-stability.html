            <p>Stewards must be able to protect their lands from the dangers of the Wyld. Activating this Charm is a dramatic action that requires the Lunar to pace the boundaries of her territory and mark it with Essence. This Charm affects a maximum area of one waypoint, the basic geographical unit of the Wyld—about 30 miles across. The Charm fails if anyone interrupts the Lunar before its completion.</p>
<p>Once the character has invoked the Charm, the Wyld energies in the region become quiescent. While the local abnormal physical (and metaphysical) laws remain the same, they do not change as long as the Charm remains effective. This Charm cannot affect territory owned (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 283) by another Essence user, which are more common in the Wyld than in Creation. While the Charm is active, Fair Folk (and other Wyld denizens) with Essence less than the Lunar&rsquo;s cannot affect the region with shaping actions or effects.</p>
<p>A Lunar cannot always stay to protect the territory she claims in the Wyld. By sacrificing one dot of permanent Willpower (which the character may regain through experience points), the character no longer needs to spend further Willpower to maintain the Ritual of Lunar Stability and can give the Charm its monthly 10 motes no matter where she is. The perpetuated Charm is tied to a small object of the Lunar&rsquo;s choice; destroying the object instantly destroys the Charm.</p>
<p>Lunars use this Charm to solidify their personal redoubts or make their lands safer against the Wyld. In the First Age, the Ritual of Lunar Stability often accompanied an invocation of Wyld-Shaping Technique in the Deep Wyld to protect the new annexation from being reabsorbed by chaos.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>When one of the Lunar Exalts hunts a person and adds that body to the Lunar&rsquo;s library of forms, the victim&rsquo;s star flickers out and dies. Victims of the sacred hunt become invalid targets for astrology and other effects that target them by name or specific identity. Lunars occasionally find this weakness in their perfect disguises detrimental.</p>
<p>This Knack prevents that problem. When the Lunar takes a new human shape, she also consumes that person&rsquo;s destiny, though it remains subordinate to her own destiny and will. As long as the Lunar lives, so do the stars of every person whose heart&rsquo;s blood she took after learning this Knack. Effects that target those individuals specifically, such as Sidereal astrology and some spells, function against her (or to her benefit).</p>
<p>Ongoing effects, such as those from astrology, affect the Lunar whenever she assumes the targeted form. Instantaneous effects, such as an invocation of Infallible Messenger, target the Lunar no matter her current form. She may reflexively refuse any such an effect before it takes place; she does not know what the effect is without the use of Charms, and the effect&rsquo;s instigator realizes there is some unknown malfunction.</p>
<p>Forms that the Lunar possessed before she learned this Knack have already been stricken from Heaven&rsquo;s records; their stars do not return to the sky.</p>

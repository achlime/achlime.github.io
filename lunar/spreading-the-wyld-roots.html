        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Within the Wyld, space is not always a matter of here and there. Sometimes, one location is in multiple places, or many points all fit into one small space. Though the Lunar Exalted are immune to such space-bending (to a degree), some learn how to exploit it. By perceiving and striking at one such multispatial point, or perhaps creating it with the Charm, the character attacks (Essence) points simultaneously with a single blow.</p>
<p>The character may target multiple individuals (who must all be within 30 yards), a single person or any mix thereof. Attacking one target with multiple strikes reduces that target&rsquo;s Defense Value by the total number of blows laid on the target, as if multiple people launched a coordinated attack.</p>
<p><em>Example: A Lunar with Essence 4 levies three blows against one target and one against another. The first target suffers a -3 DV penalty against the attack; the second target suffers no penalty. By attacking each target with two blows, the Lunar could give each a -2 DV penalty instead.</em></p>
<p>The Lunar&rsquo;s player only rolls a single attack, which is applied against the Defense Values of all chosen targets simultaneously.</p>

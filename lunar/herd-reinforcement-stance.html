            <p>Stewards help shape societies, strengthening them as appropriate. This Charm targets one person or one social unit, immediately creating a fully fledged Intimacy in the target. The Intimacy is either to the target&rsquo;s native culture or society or to the culture and society to which the target is currently exposed. If the new Intimacy is mutually exclusive with the target&rsquo;s Motivation, the Intimacy fails; if it cannot coexist with an existing Intimacy, the Lunar&rsquo;s player rolls (Charisma + Essence) at a difficulty of the target&rsquo;s (Conviction + Magnitude) to override the conflicting Intimacy. (Individuals have Magnitude 0.)</p>
<p>When this Charm makes the target have too many Intimacies, one older and weaker Intimacy drops out at the end of the story unless the target makes an effort to retain it. Regardless, Herd Reinforcing Stance also functions as an automatic mental dodge against any attempts to undermine this new Intimacy for the rest of the scene.</p>
<p>Though there is no roll, this Charm uses unnatural mental influence. It may be countered any time within 24 hours of its Charm use by spending two points of Willpower (or four points of Loyalty for a group). After that time, the Charm-created Intimacy becomes natural to the target.</p>
<p>This Charm functions in Mandate of Heaven to add the Lunar&rsquo;s Charisma to a roll in defense against a conquest or diplomatic action that would obviously harm the dominion.</p>

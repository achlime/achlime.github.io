            <p>Spending five long ticks in contact with a nonorganic material allows the Lunar to subsume herself into it as a normal shapeshifting action. She may sink into the ground, becoming earth herself, or merge with a stone wall, becoming granite or marble as desired. The Lunar may remain merged within the substance for as long as desired, but she cannot move, speak or act, and she takes a -2 external penalty to all attempts to perceive her surroundings. Yet, she is impossible to locate without Essence sight. She may emerge from her tomb at any time as a reflexive action. She is automatically ejected if the surface in which she is hiding is damaged.</p>
<p>Characters age at only half the normal rate while merged with a substance through this Knack.</p>

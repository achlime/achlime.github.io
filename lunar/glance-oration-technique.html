        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar&rsquo;s body language becomes incredibly graceful, eloquent and effective. With a single sultry glance, a subtle turn of the head, the lightest caress or many other aspects of body language, the character can communicate as effectively and completely in a silent instant as he can with a lengthy speech. He can use Performance, Presence, Socialize and other Abilities potentially hindered by a lack of speech, and he reduces the Speed of all social combat actions by one while the Charm lasts. Outside of social combat, the character may communicate significant messages instantly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the character can speak to anyone or anything, regardless of native tongue, though he may not always understand the answer. Many things are unable to comprehend the Lunar&rsquo;s message or respond, such as rocks, but he can still communicate with them easily with only his appearance and body language. This is especially useful when a Lunar finds human form imprudent, but wants to tell someone that a Realm legion approaches or her child is trapped in a collapsed mineshaft.</p>

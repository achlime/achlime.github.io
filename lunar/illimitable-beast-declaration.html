        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunars who develop this Knack for their shapeshifting know no limit to the size of natural animals they may hunt. It extends the capabilities of Emerald Grasshopper Form into the infinitesimal, so there is no natural animal too small. It likewise improves Towering Beast Form into the infinite, so no natural animal is too large. If the Lunar cannot hunt a natural animal that is larger than the Last Supplicant or smaller than the head of a pin, it is not because he lacks the ability—it is because the animal does not exist.</p>
<p>A character without Emerald Grasshopper Form is limited to infinitely larger forms and one without Towering Beast Form is limited to infinitely smaller forms. Possessing small forms, such as a flea or a tiny krill, add 3 or more to the Lunar&rsquo;s DVs (though also probably make parrying impossible). Lunars who take enormous forms also learn to absorb massive amounts of damage, as successfully evading an attack becomes increasingly unlikely with growing size.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Stewards are as aware of their territory as the spider is aware of its web. The character using this Charm becomes completely aware of the region known as her territory. She must own the territory as a person owns an object (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 238); she may target an area no greater than (Essence x 10) square miles at a single time; and she must be within the targeted territory for the Charm to function.</p>
<p>Once the Charm activates, the character may use Perception with any appropriate Abilities to notice or seek out things within the affected territory. Anything that normally would be a valid target for such a roll in her presence becomes a valid target if it lies within her territory. The character may enhance her perceptive abilities with any Charms at her disposal. This awareness of her territory does not conflict with her awareness of her surroundings, and unusual events within her territory merit reflexive (Perception + Awareness) rolls.</p>
<p>Elder Lunars, especially paranoid ones, keep this Charm active at all times.</p>

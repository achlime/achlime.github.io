        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Powerful Lunars can teach their bodies to acclimatize to even the most dangerous things, rending the Lunars proof against what has already hurt them. After activating this Charm, any form of attack or event that causes the Lunar harm (i.e., at least a health level of damage or a dot of trait degradation) ceases to be a danger to him for the rest of the scene. Raw damage from any such sources automatically drops to zero in Step 7 of attack resolution. Other sources of damage still affect the character: A Lunar can only use Wound-Mastering Body Evolution against one form of attack or damage at a time. Multiple activations of Wound-Mastering Body Evolution can be stacked simultaneously to benefit from multiple immunities.</p>
<p>While the Charm provides perfect immunity to all damage from mundane sources, magical attacks and harmful effects are capable of penetrating its protection. Against magical harm, the Lunar instead gains +15B/15L natural soak, 10B/10L Hardness, and (Essence ÷ 2) automatic successes on any rolls to avoid being damaged. Attacks or effects are magical if enhanced by a Charm or other Essence power, if made with an inherently magical weapon, or if used by a character with Essence 4+.</p>
<p>Wound-Mastering Body Evolution is activated in Step 10 of an attack against the Lunar to secure immunity to that source of damage. This Charm is given power by the Lunar&rsquo;s survival instinct and desperate perseverance, and so can only be used if the Lunar is injured against his will. He cannot simply harm himself or allow an ally to do so in order to gain immunity.</p>
<p>Divide sources of damage in the same way that Exalted separates weapons. Edged weapons form one category, blunt weapons are another and so on. Artifact weapons have their own spread of the categories separate from the mundane weapons but are not separated by magical material. Fire, strangulation, crushing, acid and the like all have their own categories. Some unique effects may not fall into any category, and thus always harm the character at least once before he becomes temporarily immune.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The single most important Charm known to Lunars creates the magical tattoos that protect them from the Wyld and fix their castes. The entire process of tattooing can take days—as long as the character thinks is necessary to get a feel for the novice Lunar&rsquo;s aptitudes and life story. The user of this Charm also needs mundane tools and certain Abilities to prepare and use the moonsilver ink: Lore 3 to create the ink and Craft (Air or Wood) 1 to perform the tattooing. Alternatively, the character can do the work entirely by magic using Lunar Blade Reconfiguration. (This is not a Combo; the Charms may be used together by special dispensation.) The experience points spent are gone forever.</p>
<p>Note that this Charm also presumes the character himself is a tattooed Lunar: the Charm draws upon the stabilizing magic in the character&rsquo;s own body to impart the enchanted tattoos to another Lunar. Recreating the moonsilver tattoos from scratch would involve crafting a four-dot artifact. Even with the help of Luna&rsquo;s Blessed Hands, the intrepid character would need multiple Attributes and Abilities rated 5 or higher.</p>

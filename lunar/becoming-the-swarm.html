        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Knack enables the Lunar to subdivide his body into a swarm of lesser creatures. These creatures individually may be no larger than a rat. The Lunar is free to mix and match different types of creatures in the swarm, but if he wishes to use unconventional forms of locomotion (such as flight or crawling up walls) all creatures comprising the swarm must be capable of such movement.</p>
<p>The swarm encompasses an area (Stamina x 2) yards in diameter and retains all of the Lunar&rsquo;s usual Attributes and Abilities. The only attack it is capable of is a clinch (Accuracy +4, Damage +[Essence] L, Defense —, Rate 1, Tags C,N,P). In lieu of crushing the target, a swarm consisting primarily of venomous animals may instead inflict a toxin on the victim during a successful clinch, equivalent to arrow frog venom (see Exalted, p. 131). The swarm treats all attacks against it as unblockable, but adds an amount equal to half the character&rsquo;s Dexterity to its Dodge DV against attacks that are not large enough to encompass the entire swarm.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar&rsquo;s anima condenses into a shimmering path of pure moonlight that arches up and into the air, stretching far away into the distance before her. This path, which quickly levels out and runs a mile above the ground, is shorter than it appears, spanning the hidden gaps in the night sky that only Luna knows, and will speed a Steward&rsquo;s trip between her territories.</p>
<p>The character may only activate this Charm at night within the boundaries of a territory she owns, and she may only use it to travel directly toward another territory that she owns (see Exalted, p. 238). The Lunar doubles the amount of ground she covers while she proceeds along this moonbeam path, after the effects of all other Charms or magic. This Charm automatically ends when the sun rises; Lunars are thus advised to take to the ground before dawn, lest they suddenly find themselves bereft of road while a mile up in the air. The Lunar may activate this Charm at the next sunset to resume her journey if she has not diverted more than two miles from the course to her destination during the day, despite being outside of an owned territory.</p>

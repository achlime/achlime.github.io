        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Sometimes, the Lunar Exalted don&rsquo;t have time to perform a full blood hunt, or need to take a shape without killing its owner. A Lunar can take on an animal&rsquo;s (or human&rsquo;s) shape without performing the sacred hunt so long as he gets a taste of its blood.</p>
<p>The new form does not last long. A simple taste of blood, even a minor trickle, gives the Lunar access to the shape for the next hour. More blood, which must be drawn by the character and accompanied by some sharp pain (inflicting at least one lethal health level), adds the shape to the character&rsquo;s library for one full day. The duration begins counting down the moment the blood leaves the body—a Lunar may not store blood for later use or lick up old, dried blood for the benefit. Any creature that is a valid target for the Lunar&rsquo;s sacred hunt can provide this benefit.</p>
<p>Without activating the blood hunt, a Lunar may take as little as a few minutes to find the blood of the right creature (for common, small animals) or a half-hour to an hour for larger or less common animals. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, this may take even longer, but it should never take more than half as long as the sacred hunt for the equivalent creature.</p>

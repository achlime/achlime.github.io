        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The breeding of beastmen was held to be a shameful and private activity in the First Age. Lunars in the Age of Sorrows cannot bother to be constrained by the squeamishness of their mates or contemporaries, and have delved into the outer limits of their generative capabilities.</p>
<p>In the proper circumstances to bring a beastman into the world, the character spends one mote at the moment of conception (or attempted conception, in the case of Lunars wearing a male form—this Charm does not ensure impregnation). By doing so, the character may imprint the child with features from any shape in her Heart&rsquo;s Blood library, including her spirit shape, rather than being restricted to the form she currently wears.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>To strike at a Steward brings swift retribution. Bending and moving with a snake&rsquo;s grace, the Lunar smoothly redirects an attack back toward its instigator. The attacker must be within the character&rsquo;s Melee or Martial Arts range. The Lunar may dodge into a blow and then shove the blade into her opponent or scamper through her foe&rsquo;s legs so he shoots himself in the foot—good stunts are the nature of this Charm.</p>
<p>Using this Charm allows the character to ignore all penalties to her defense against a single attack. As long as the character can successfully dodge or parry the attack, she counterattacks by forcing her enemy to suffer his own attack. Counterattack resolution begins in Step 7, as every success the attacker&rsquo;s player rolled is applied to his own soak. Any effects that would have taken place had the attack hit the Lunar affect the attacker. Also, the Lunar may use Charms or other supernatural powers to affect the damage as if she had started the attack (though they must be legally useable—either scenelong or in a Combo with Snake Body Technique).</p>
<p>Although declared in Step 2, this Charm resolves as normal for a counterattack in step 9, permitting the original aggressor to defend himself against his redirected attack.</p>

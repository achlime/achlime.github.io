        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>A favorite Charm of the Wardens of Gaia, Moon and Earth Blessing instills a land with supernatural fecundity and fertility. The Lunar paces out the limits of the land she wishes to bless, stopping frequently to blaze marks into trees or stones, or to scuff patterns into the dirt that she believes will be pleasing to the Argent Madonna and the Emerald Mother. A single use of this Charm may bless a landscape up to (Essence) miles across. Once the Lunar&rsquo;s circuit is finished, her nocturnal Essence suffuses the land. Even the most barren tundra, harshest desert or vilest swamp soon becomes fertile and abundant: new growth appears, the soil readily accepts crops, and small animals are drawn to the region. This area is marked with the strangeness of Luna&rsquo;s blessing in minor ways; one pumpkin out of a patch might contain small glowing lights that drift away into the air rather than seeds, for example, while night-blooming flowers are likely to proliferate, and owls flock to the regions more than any other birds. All Survival rolls in the area reduce their difficulty to 1. This blessing lasts for a year and a day, after which the area&rsquo;s fecundity may increase or disperse according to local weather and the persistence or lack thereof of efforts to cultivate the land (it is easier to keep a land fertile in the East than on a glacier in the far North, for example).</p>
<p>If used within a territory the Lunar owns, this Charm&rsquo;s blessing lasts until the Lunar no longer owns the territory.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>In addition to injecting a venom with his attacks, the Lunar can also learn exude acid from his palms or spit it from his mouth. Cobra Eye Method adds acids and other damaging reagents to the list of natural substances he can, after experiencing them, create. This Charm is a single attack, either a natural attack or a launch from the character&rsquo;s mouth. The latter attack uses (Dexterity + [Athletics or Thrown]) at a -2 accuracy, with range 5.</p>
<p>The character may also invent his own supernatural acids, each of requires four experience points or two bonus points to purchase. Samples follow.</p>
<p><strong>Burning Tar:</strong> This acid is gummy, sickly green and sticky. It inflicts eight lethal damage when first inflicted on a target and the same on each of the target&rsquo;s subsequent actions until someone removes the acid. Scraping off the acid is a miscellaneous action (-1 Defense Value) that does not require a roll.</p>
<p><strong>Foe-Softening Discharge:</strong> Clear and sharp-smelling, this secretion does not inflict damage. When this acid strikes a foe, the Lunar&rsquo;s player chooses one of his target&rsquo;s Physical Attributes, Appearance or Perception and rolls (Stamina + Essence) at a difficulty equal to the target Attribute. Success on the roll reduces that Attribute by one dot. Exalted heal this damage at one dot per week, but the damage is usually permanent for mortals.</p>
<p><strong>Soporific Nectar:</strong> This white fluid gives off a powerful aroma that can set most creatures reeling. As long as the Nectar connects with its target, the Lunar&rsquo;s player rolls (Stamina + [Medicine or Survival]) at a difficulty of the target&rsquo;s Stamina. Success fills all the target&rsquo;s remaining health levels with bashing damage down to the -4 box; only Incapacitated remains empty.</p>
<p><strong>Steel-Eater:</strong> This dull gray, watery acid inflicts only three lethal damage against creatures and quickly loses its potency. When used to target steel objects, such as many weapons or armors, this acid inflicts 10 lethal damage and ignores Hardness. Characters do not soak this. Instead, their weapons or armor soak with their own damage or soak ratings, respectively. Each die of damage left afterward automatically reduces the target object&rsquo;s damage or soak (or health levels, for items neither weapons nor armor) by one. Weapons reduced to +0 damage and armor reduced to no soak are considered destroyed. Some weapons or armors, especially family heirlooms, may be reparable at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With practice, a Lunar can learn to consume a bit of a human&rsquo;s mind and soul along with his body. This Knack creates one &ldquo;floating&rdquo; Ability dot. Each scene, the Lunar can allocate this dot to an Ability held by a human whose form the Lunar took, but that he himself lacks. If a Lunar also has Life of the Hummingbird, he can access the Abilities of a person whose shape the Lunar has temporarily stolen. The &ldquo;floating&rdquo; Ability dot cannot be raised through training (though the character could train himself, using the stolen memories, to gain his first dot in an Ability) and cannot be added to Abilities the Lunar has already. Calling up an Ability this way costs one Willpower per scene.</p>
<p>At Essence 5 and Intelligence 5, a Lunar can buy this Knack again to gain two &ldquo;floating&rdquo; Ability dots. These cannot stack: Each point must carry a different Ability. Linguistics or Craft are special exceptions: The character could assign the dots to two different languages or gain one dot each in two different crafts, such as Craft (Air) and Craft (Wood).</p>
<p>See also <a class="complex" href="lessons-in-the-blood.html" title="canonical entry of charm 'Lessons in the Blood'"><span class="link-focus">Lessons in the Blood</span></a> (p. 189), which does something similar.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By paying an extra point of Willpower, the Steward may expand his swarm form into an allencompassing plague that sweeps across the land, stripping crops and flesh alike bare in moments. The rules for swarm composition and movement are identical to Becoming the Swarm.</p>
<p>The cloud covers an area (Stamina x 20) yards in diameter. Characters trapped within are subjected to an ongoing environmental attack with a Damage of (Strength)L/action and a Trauma of 2. If the cloud consists primarily of venomous animals, the Lunar may inflict a poison equivalent to arrow frog venom rather than damage during each damage interval. The Lunar is immune to any attack that encompasses less than one-fifth of his total mass (any sufficiently large attack is considered unblockable). The only action he can take as a swarm cloud is a special &ldquo;apply environmental damage&rdquo; miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -1) that leaves him able to observe his surroundings, apply his Dodge DV and move. (This miscellaneous action may not be part of a flurry.) Three motes must be paid on each action in order to sustain this form.</p>

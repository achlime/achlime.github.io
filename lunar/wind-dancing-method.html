        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Stewards are always where they need to be, nowhere else. The character may activate this Charm after using her Defense Value to defend against an attack, successful or not. In Step 9 of attack resolution, she skips lightly away from her aggressor. As part of a dodge, she may leap away; when parrying, the Lunar may let the attack she blocks propel her along. The character moves (Dexterity + Dodge) yards in any direction of her choice, so long as she moves generally away from her attacker.</p>
<p>Lunars use this Charm to get out of range of a closecombat flurry, forcing the flurry to end if the attacker does not have enough movement to keep up with her. Against ranged opponents, this Charm can help the character quickly find cover or make the attack more difficult due to range.</p>
<p>This Charm counts as a counterattack, so it reduces the character&rsquo;s Defense Value by one and cannot be used against a counterattack.</p>

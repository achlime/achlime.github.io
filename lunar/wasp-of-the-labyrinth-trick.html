        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Having slain a foe, the Lunar may make use of her victim&rsquo;s body. Upon using this Charm, a six-inch stinger emerges from the Exalt&rsquo;s wrist. Targeting the necrotic Essence gathering in the corpse, she drives this spike into her target&rsquo;s body, releasing her Essence into the cadaver and catalyzing the necrotic power there to form thousands of Essence-born parasites which spread throughout it. The parasitic larvae attach themselves to its bones and organs, while vastly slowing down its natural decay. The parasites animate the corpse on the Lunar&rsquo;s next action, turning it into an automaton which is completely obedient to the her (use the traits for a zombie found on page 314 of <strong>Exalted</strong>).</p>
<p>The Lunar may expressly use this Charm on zombies to gain control of them with a successful Dexterity + Martial Arts attack; if the zombie is already under another being&rsquo;s command, the Lunar must make an Intelligence + Occult roll at a difficulty of the current master&rsquo;s Essence to wrest away control of it. Should the Lunar drop the mote committed to this Charm, the parasites dissolve and the corpse rapidly decays on the spot. If the undead was animated by previous forms of magic, it simply resumes its normal functions. The Lunar may animate or control as many undead as she cares to commit Essence to sustain.</p>

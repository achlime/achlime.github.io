        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Luna&rsquo;s tricksters know that the illusion of power is often as useful as power itself. This Charm enables a Lunar to convince onlookers that some ordinary object has magical powers. People actually see the sword blaze with deadly power, the potion purge disease or the jewel glow with channeled Essence.</p>
<p>The Lunar&rsquo;s player rolls (Manipulation + [relevant Ability] + Essence). The Ability may be Melee for an ersatz artifact weapon, Medicine for a phony potion, Lore for a fake hearthstone, or whatever seems appropriate. Any target with a Dodge Mental Defense Value less than the resulting successes sees the supposed magical item perform whatever magic the Lunar suggests. Magical effects of great power, however, can impose external penalties: It&rsquo;s easier to convince people of a false hearthstone than that a false Essence cannon just blew up a fortress. Anyone who spends a point of Willpower sees through the illusion; and the illusion fails as soon as anyone puts the supposed artifact or its effects to the test. For instance, a person might think a &ldquo;magical&rdquo; purse turns common pebbles to jade—but when he tries to sell the jade, the buyer sees only pebbles, points this out, and the illusion is revealed.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Spreading his hands over a vessel of recorded knowledge (a memory crystal, a book, a set of wall carvings), the Lunar imbues the surface or object with his Essence, causing it to radiate a soft argent glow. For 10 minutes, he allows his Essence to permeate the vessel, then withdraws it into himself. The Lunar immediately gains a general knowledge of all information held within the targeted source. He cannot recall enough specific detail to quote passages (because he has not read them), but he knows generally what information they conveyed. This Charm transcends language barriers.</p>
<p>The level of detail gained from this Charm is insufficient to allow the Lunar to learn Charms or spells, though he would become aware of, say, all the spells contained within a sorcerous manual and what they generally did. Actually learning the spells would require studying the manual normally.</p>

            <p>This Knack allows the Lunar to pay 10m, 1wp to assume the form of a natural geographic feature—a cloud bank, a mountain, a forest, a stretch of river, a creeping fog. The Lunar must have within her heart&rsquo;s blood library the form of a spirit corresponding to the feature she wishes to become—a river god, for example, if she wishes to become a river. The Lunar is only semi-mobile in this form, moving at most ten miles per day, and unable to directly act upon anything venturing within her boundaries, though she may observe the interior of her being from any point as though she were present, and adds three dice to all Perception rolls to notice intruders within her. While not immune to damage in landscape form, per se, the Lunar is formidably protected—destroying a Lunar wearing the form of a mountain, for example, would likely require Solar Circle sorcery or powerful artifacts of mass destruction.</p>
<p>The Lunar may not destroy any existing landscape features by using this Knack; existing geography instead reconfigures itself to account for the new inclusion. For example, if the Lunar were to become a river winding its way through the middle of Whitewall, the city&rsquo;s streets and roads would temporarily route themselves around it, span the Lunar with bridges, and so forth. A Lunar who became a forest in Nexus would briefly transform Nexus into a thriving trade city located in the heart of a forest. The Lunar also may not assume a geographic form in a place where it is impossible for that feature to exist (clouds, for example, are rarely found underwater, and mountains and rivers generally do not float two hundred feet above the ground), unless she is in the Wyld. Finally, the Lunar&rsquo;s Tell extends to blanket her in a veil of normalcy; observers must pierce the Tell in order to realize there is anything unusual about a mountain suddenly springing up overnight.</p>

            <p>Besieging the Bastion of Form improves its prerequisite. The Lunar may spend an additional five motes of Essence and one point of Willpower when activating Form-Destroying Touch to add one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sickness effect progresses much more rapidly. After it would normally begin harming its victim, the victim&rsquo;s player must roll to resist damage and mutation every hour instead of every day. The Charm runs its course after 25 more hours.</li>
<li>The Sickness effect continues to affect its victim until the victim dies or something cures the supernatural disease.</li>
<li>Failure to resist the Sickness effect inflicts two levels of aggravated damage but no pox. Alternatively, failure afflicts the victim with two poxes but no aggravated damage. Poxes may double up to cause a single affliction or promote an existing mutation faster than normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon purchase of Besieging the Bastion of Form, a player picks one of the preceding options. Additional options cost two experience points apiece. Storytellers and players may work together to come up with more options. A character can apply only one option to a single use of Form-Destroying Touch.</p>

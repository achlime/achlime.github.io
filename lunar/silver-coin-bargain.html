        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar weaves an illusion into a gift, imbuing it with greater symbolic significance. Even if the present itself is meaningless, it seems so important and meaningful that it cannot help but demand obligation from whomever the Lunar gives it to. Using this Charm requires the Lunar to offer an object she owns to the Charm&rsquo;s target. The recipient must accept the gift or the Charm automatically fails, so prior persuasion may be needed to ensure cooperation. Provided that the gift is accepted, the Lunar&rsquo;s player rolls (Manipulation + Presence) as an undodgeable social attack, adding bonus successes equal to the gifts&rsquo;s Resources value. Artifacts have a Resources value of (Artifact rating + 2, maximum 5). If the target is convinced the gift is worth more than its actual value, the bonus uses apparent value instead.</p>
<p>If the social attack succeeds, Silver Coin Bargain infuses the recipient with a strong sense of gratitude and obligation towards the Lunar. This unnatural Emotion/Servitude effect lingers deep in the target&rsquo;s psyche, attached by the metaphysical link of owning and retaining access to the gift. Should he lose ownership or access to the item for any reason, his latent gratitude fades at the end of the scene. Consequently, durable gifts provide durable indebtedness, while an extravagant meal only creates gratitude for the scene of the meal itself. The target may not voluntarily rid himself of the gift to break its hold on him unless he pays four Willpower. Gifts may be gotten rid of without paying Willpower in accordance with their intended function, such as easting a meal or spending a gift of money. The Storyteller remains final arbiter of what functions qualify for this exemption.</p>
<p>The Lunar can draw upon the feelings imposed by Silver Coin Bargain to request any single task as a form of repayment. No new social attack is required; communication of desire is sufficient. From that moment on, the target&rsquo;s sense of obligation clouds his judgment and causes him to spend at least 10 hours per day working toward the assigned task by the best means available to him until he completes it. At any point, he can pay four Willpower to get rid of the gift as mentioned. The same cost also allows him to remember that gifts do not demand repayment, breaking the specific present&rsquo;s hold on his soul.</p>

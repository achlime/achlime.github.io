        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Creation holds thousands of unique poisons and drugs, enough to make a dedicated assassin or hedonist despair at ever having them all on hand. Some Stewards find another avenue, for which they were much-loved in the First Age. Once a character has suffered the effects of a foreign substance on her body, she may reproduce it (assuming, of course, she survives).</p>
<p>The character may use a replicated drug, disease or poison in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>She may channel it directly into her system, feeling its effect immediately.</li>
<li>She may excrete it onto a single weapon (natural or not), inflicting it upon the victim of her next successful attack. The usual method is to spit on a weapon. The character may activate Scorpion and Toad Mastery in Step 1 of attack resolution to invoke it with an attack.</li>
<li>She can milk it from her flesh, much as poison-sellers harvest venom from snakes, creating a sample that may be used later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a poison or drug costs a number of motes equal to twice the substance&rsquo;s Resources value. The cost to generate a disease is equal to the disease&rsquo;s virulence.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunar Exalted learn much from their prey. By consuming the mind of a creature, the character using this Charm learns what that entity knew. Devouring a brain takes an instant (for the smallest), 10 minutes (for a normal-sized human) or longer (for behemoths and other strange creatures). More exotic targets require the character to consume the seat of their minds, which he locates with a ([Perception or Intelligence] + Occult) roll. The character then has access to everything the creature once knew. For animals, this amounts to a few subtle instincts and familiarity with the region—the animal&rsquo;s den and sources of food. People&rsquo;s knowledge is more varied and valuable.</p>
<p>Any time during the Charm&rsquo;s duration, the character can rummage through the victim&rsquo;s memory as a miscellaneous action. The victim&rsquo;s clear memories are just as clear to the Lunar. Things a victim barely recalled require an (Intelligence + Investigation) roll to find, and the foggiest memories are at difficulty 2+. Digging out something the victim kept secret (while alive) requires the same roll at a difficulty equal to the victim&rsquo;s Integrity.</p>
<p>If the character uses this Charm on a target whose form he can take, he may spend one experience point to call upon the creature&rsquo;s memories as long as he retains the shape. (It is most useful to buy this benefit after a successful sacred hunt.) When in that form thereafter, he can activate this Charm to call upon those memories for another hour. Predator&rsquo;s Insight is a grotesque way to learn new Charms or Abilities, if the player has enough experience points to spend.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Just as a wasp digests paper to make its hive or certain creatures of the earth use their saliva to reinforce their burrows, the Lunar infuses an object with Wyld-bearing Essence to make it malleable. Invoking the Charm, the character chooses one discrete object of any mundane material. For the rest of the scene, the character may reshape the object with a brush of his hands. To everyone else, the object remains as hard as normal. Clay-Wetting Practice cannot affect the magical materials.</p>
<p>When a Lunar targets an object no larger than he can hold in one hand, he may reshape that object as a miscellaneous action into any similar object of the same material and Resources value or less. Some Lunars use this Charm in combat so they always have the most appropriate weapon for the moment, although it doesn&rsquo;t work as well as Weapon-Shaping Method. Clay-Wetting Practice creates only average goods.</p>
<p>Clay-Wetting Practice also makes unworkable materials valid targets for Craft actions and eliminates any penalty for working without tools. In normal working conditions, this Charm reduces the target Resources value by one for determining the task&rsquo;s difficulty and time required, though long-term projects require many invocations of this Charm. Projects that normally involve dozens or hundreds of workers do not benefit from this Charm.</p>
<p>Characters may use this Charm to damage an object quickly. A Lunar ignores (Dexterity x 2) points of an object&rsquo;s soak after affecting it with this Charm.</p>

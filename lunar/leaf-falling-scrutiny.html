            <p>Stewards know who resides within their territories and what they can do. Lunars read people well, finding the smallest tells of familiarity and habit to determine a person&rsquo;s training. They use this Charm in the following three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lunar may target specific individuals and determine if the target has a faculty with one named Ability. In general, this tells the player the target&rsquo;s rating in the named Ability.</li>
<li>A character may also examine someone and determine that person&rsquo;s highest-rated Ability. In the case of a tie, the character learns one and knows that there are others; further invocations of Leaf-Falling Scrutiny reveal skills not yet perceived by the Lunar.</li>
<li>The player can name an Ability, and the character judges everyone within her sight. The character detects people who possess the Ability at three dots or higher. People the character does not see (because they use Stealth or other means to remain unnoticed) are not judged. The group&rsquo;s Magnitude may not exceed the Lunar&rsquo;s permanent Essence.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Charm allows a reflexive (Perception + [the named Ability] roll at standard difficulty. When targets want to conceal their skills or natures, the difficulty becomes the target&rsquo;s (higher of Manipulation or Socialize).</p>
<p>Lunars use the mass version of this Charm to quickly find people suited for a particular task: sailors to man a boat or warriors for a raid, for example.</p>

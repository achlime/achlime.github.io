        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar Exalted recognize their own and can sniff out other supernatural creatures. When a character activates this Charm, his player names a type of supernatural creature. A single sniff or glance informs the character whether any being of that type is within (Essence x 5) yards, if the player succeeds at a (Perception + Essence) roll with a difficulty of the highest permanent Essence of any creature in the area, whether it&rsquo;s the named type or not (but not counting the Lunar himself). The Lunar also knows who falls into that category out of those people he can detect.</p>
<p>Although there is a little or least god for nearly every thing in Creation, only self-aware and active gods trigger Fellow Hound Insight. Otherwise, activating it to detect gods in Creation would be a near-pointless endeavor.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Moonsilver is a gift from Luna, and this Charm enhances that gift. Once this Charm is active, an attuned moonsilver weapon can become nearly any weapon of the Exalted. On her action, the Lunar may reflexively change the target into any other weapon of equal or lesser Artifact rating. If she so chooses, she may also change the target into any mundane weapon, which benefits from the moonsilver material bonus.</p>
<p>Any magical functions the weapon possesses (besides its basic weapon traits) function in all its forms unless they depend on the weapon&rsquo;s shape. For instance, a dire lance that increases damage even further when charging does not keep that bonus in the shape of a daiklave. At the end of the scene, the weapon returns to its original form.</p>
<p>When presented with an unworked nugget or deposit of moonsilver, this Charm allows a character to shape the material reflexively into any mundane weapon. Such weapons do not benefit from the moonsilver magical material bonus—they are not actually artifacts, and they are not attuned. At the end of the scene, the reconfigured moonsilver returns to its original shape.</p>

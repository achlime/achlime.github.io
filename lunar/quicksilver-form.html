            <p>No cage can contain the chimera. As a simple action, the chimera can reduce its entire body into a viscous material that flows effortlessly according to his will. In this form, the chimera can flow through any opening, no matter how small, although very tiny openings may take a long time to pass through. While in this form, the chimera becomes more vulnerable to powerful blunt attacks than to cutting attacks. Treat lethal cutting damage as normal bashing damage, but double the pre-soak damage of all normal bashing attacks. Lethal damage that is not based on cutting attacks (fire, acid and the like) is treated normally; so is aggravated damage. Activating Quicksilver Form requires a commitment of five motes of Essence.</p>

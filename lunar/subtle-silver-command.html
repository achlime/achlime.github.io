        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>With the great force of her personality, a Steward shares the power of her will and beliefs with another. This Charm is an unnatural mental influence that the character may exert even on targets that normally are not valid targets for social attacks, such as sleeping people. Such targets may only defend with their Dodge Mental Defense Values and suffer a -2 penalty to that.</p>
<p>The Lunar&rsquo;s player rolls (Charisma + Presence) against the target&rsquo;s Mental Defense Value. Success levies a Compulsion effect on the target to act as though she shares one of the Lunar&rsquo;s powerful beliefs. The target acts as though she has the character&rsquo;s Motivation, one of the character&rsquo;s Intimacies or one Virtue equal to the Lunar&rsquo;s (which must be rated at three dots or higher). This compulsion becomes the greatest thing in the target&rsquo;s life, overwhelming other Intimacies and the target&rsquo;s natural Motivation for the duration.</p>
<p>Targets of this Charm may spend a point of Willpower to resist the compulsion for a full day or three points to cancel it entirely. People targeted when they were unaware of the Charm never know they had anything other than a sudden epiphany. Other targets know the Lunar somehow inspired them to a different belief.</p>

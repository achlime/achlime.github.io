        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunars are the absolute masters of their territory, and no territory is more sacred than a Steward&rsquo;s own body. This Charm may be activated in response to any attack that successfully rolls damage against the Lunar, provided that attack is made with a weapon not possessing the N tag. The character makes an unblockable (Stamina + Athletics + levels of damage inflicted by the attack) counterattack, opposed by the original attacker&rsquo;s Dodge DV. Success traps the offending weapon within or against the Lunar&rsquo;s body; her blood congeals into a powerful bonding agent at the point of impact even as her body extrudes a sturdy cage of bone to hold the weapon in place. The weapon remains trapped as long as the Lunar commits Essence to this Charm, up to a maximum duration of one scene.</p>
<p>Reclaiming a captured weapon requires a miscellaneous Speed 5, DV -2 action in which the attacker rolls (Strength + Athletics) against a difficulty of the Lunar&rsquo;s Stamina. Should the attacker release her weapon while the Lunar holds it, a barehanded Martial Arts attack roll may be necessary to grasp it again in order to attempt to draw it out. The Lunar may hold up to (Essence) weapons with her body at once, but each held weapon imposes a -1 mobility penalty (as though from armor).</p>

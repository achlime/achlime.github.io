        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>To be masters of infiltration, the Lunar Exalted must mimic their victims&rsquo; powers. Essential Mirror Form gives the Lunar the ability to use the Essence-based powers of one kind of supernatural creature, as defined by the Knacks that make them valid targets of the sacred hunt. This includes basic elemental powers such as <a class="complex unresolved" title="Unresolved text body link"><span class="link-focus">Dragon’s Suspire</span></a> and unique Charms the creatures possess. She can activate such powers only as long as she remains in the form to which those powers are natural. Each such invocation requires an additional cost of one point of Willpower, and since displaying an anima returns a Lunar to one of her true forms, the Lunar has a limited amount of Essence with which to work. If using a Charm or power acquired in this way activates the Lunar&rsquo;s anima to a degree that forces her back into a true form, the effect functions as normal. Effects with extended durations end when their descriptions say, not early because the Lunar leaves the shape.</p>
<p>This Knack can be purchased multiple times to affect additional creature types, though it never makes available the Charms of other Exalted. Primordial Charms (including those of the Yozis) are considered &ldquo;the Charms of other Exalted&rdquo; for the purpose of this Knack. This Charm also will not allow Lunars to use any Charm with the <a class="complex" href="../keywords.html#native" title="canonical entry of keyword 'Native'"><span class="link-focus">Native</span></a> Keyword. To purchase this Knack, the relevant prey must be a valid target of the sacred hunt. The Lunar must also have an Essence and Intelligence two higher than the Essence and Attribute requirements for the Knack that opens that type of creature to the Lunar&rsquo;s hunt.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Focusing her will through the bond built into her Exaltation, the Lunar repurposes that connection, pledging herself to the support of one of the Solar Exalted—not because she must, but because she wishes it so. This Charm only requires a brief touch (during which its effects are Obvious to the Solar being targeted, but not to any observers), although in the First Age it was common for it to be incorporated into formal oaths of fealty, pledges of brotherhood, or marriage vows. For each mote the Lunar commits to the Charm, she establishes one dot of Solar Bond with the Solar she is touching. This Charm may only be used to maintain a bond with one Solar at a time, and in no way obviates the Lunar&rsquo;s existing bond; indeed, if the subject of her original bond is present in the scene, the force of that original bond rises up and mutes out Silver and Gold Span the Heavens, rendering the Charm ineffective until the Lunar&rsquo;s original mate is no longer present.</p>
<p>The bond established by this Charm is mechanically considered a true Solar-Lunar bond in all ways (including the creation of an unbreakable positive Intimacy), save for the Knack <a class="complex" href="golden-widow-method.html" title="canonical entry of knack 'Golden Widow Method'"><span class="link-focus">Golden Widow Method</span></a> (see <strong>Glories of the Most High: Luna</strong>, p. 35). The Lunar must pay one Willpower to voluntarily end this Charm; doing so does not erase the Intimacy created by her temporary bond, but the Intimacy may now be eroded normally.</p>
<p>This Charm&rsquo;s bond pool is self-contained; that is to say, it refreshes at the end of the story. For example, Lilith uses the Charm to create a three point bond to Dace, and then channels all six dice. The next day she cancels Silver and Gold Span the Heavens and creates a five-point bond to Panther. Because she already spent six of her bond dice from this Charm, she only has four left to use to assist Panther. After spending them, she cancels the Charm and bonds herself to Arianna, committing five motes. Now she has no dice left to spend to help Arianna until the beginning of the next story, when her Solar Bond dice pool refreshes. Lilith also has Solar Bond 3 toward Swan, her original mate; she still has six bond dice to channel to assist him, as that pool is separate from the one created by Silver and Gold Span the Heavens.</p>
<p>If used to target an Abyssal or Infernal Exalt, this Charm&rsquo;s cost gains a one Willpower surcharge.</p>

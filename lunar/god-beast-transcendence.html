        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Knack enhances Emperor Ox Expansion. By adding an extra two-Willpower surcharge on top of the one-Willpower cost to invoke that Knack, the Lunar may swell his spirit shape into a sanity-defying behemoth, able to darken cities with its shadow and crush buildings with its tread. The Yozi Isidoros is said to consider the very existence of this Knack an affront to his majesty.</p>
<p>In addition to Emperor Ox Expansion&rsquo;s normal benefits, the Lunar also adds (Essence x 10) to his Strength for the purpose of inflicting damage, performing feats of strength and gaining control of or escaping (but not establishing) a clinch. It also adds (Essence x 10) to his Stamina for the purpose of determining soak. He also gains a natural Hardness equal to half his modified natural lethal and bashing soak, respectively. These benefits apply in both standard and mass combat.</p>
<p>The Lunar accumulates one point of Limit at the end of each scene in which this Knack is employed.</p>

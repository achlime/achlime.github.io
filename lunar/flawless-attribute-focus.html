        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunars are naturally instinctive creatures. This is part of why their Charms focus on Attributes, their natural potential, instead of the training represented by Abilities. Purchasing this Charm, the character becomes able to tap into a more specific instinctive mastery over the relevant Attribute. She learns how to purchase Attribute specialties for the given Attribute. Purchase of this Charm provides one free Attribute specialty.</p>
<p>Attribute specialties cost the same as Ability specialties to learn: three experience points, one bonus point for a non- Favored Attribute or two-for-one for a Favored Attribute at character generation. A character can have no more than three specialties for a single Attribute. Since a character cannot have Attribute specialties without first buying this Charm, it is possible to lose half a bonus point when purchasing Attribute specialties at character generation.</p>
<p>Similar to Ability specialties, Attribute specialties add extra dice to specific uses of the Attribute. Because Attributes are broader than Abilities, their specialties should be correspondingly broad. Attribute specialties may be about as restrictive as a normal specialty but cross Abilities, such as &ldquo;Forgeries&rdquo; or &ldquo;Long-Term Schemes,&rdquo; or they can include approximately one Ability, such as &ldquo;Melee&rdquo; or &ldquo;Martial Arts&rdquo; for Dexterity.</p>
<p>When channeling this deeper level of instinct, characters limit the amount of their training they can use. Attribute specialties are incompatible with normal specialties—a character must choose to use one or the other in any given instance.</p>

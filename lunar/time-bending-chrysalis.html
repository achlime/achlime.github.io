        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. First, an invisible Essence cocoon grants the Lunar +15L/15B armor soak while hibernating. Second, and more importantly, the Lunar ages in reverse while slumbering, at half the rate of time spent sleeping. For example, a Lunar who hibernated for 10 years would awaken with a body five years younger than it was when he went to sleep. This slumber never results in a loss of memories, traits or capabilities. A Lunar is considered to be his actual chronological age for the purpose of purchasing Essence dots, rather than his biological age as modified by this Charm.</p>
<p>A second purchase of this Charm, at Stamina 10+, Essence 9+, allows the character to age in reverse while hibernating in real time. If he hibernates for 10 years, he awakens 10 years physically younger.</p>
<p>Using this Charm, a character can reverse-age his body only until it reaches the physical age at which he Exalted. Time spent hibernating in excess of that limit has no further age-reversing effect. This Charm represents the current apex of Lunar anagathic study.</p>

            <p>Elementals are part of Creation—in a way, they comprise it. With this Knack, the character adds elementals to the list of the valid targets for the scared hunt. Hunting an elemental takes the same basic amount of time as hunting a human. Ending the hunt requires the Lunar to consume some vital part of the subject—for some elementals, this may cause the Lunar pain or harm. When the Lunar dons an elemental&rsquo;s shape, she acquires its elemental nature. She cannot use any of its Essence-fueled powers, but she may still benefit (or suffer) from being made of a certain element. A Lunar wearing a flaming skin may start fires or hurt others by touching them, and water may cause her harm, for example.</p>

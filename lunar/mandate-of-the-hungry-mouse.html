        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar seats herself in the lotus position and spends an hour entering a dreamlike meditative state, in which she considers a particular structured organization or group she has had dealings with in the past month. The character&rsquo;s player rolls (Intelligence + Occult), subtracting an external penalty equal to half the targeted organizaton&rsquo;s Magnitude.</p>
<p>If any successes are accumulated, then the Lunar&rsquo;s anima banner appears around her as a dim, shimmering haze, barely visible; at the conclusion of the Charm&rsquo;s use, hundreds upon hundreds of ephemeral vermin coalesce and scamper out into the world—mice and rats, hornets and serpents, centipedes and pigeons. Henceforth these phantom animals plague the efforts of the target organization: mice eat a bureau&rsquo;s paperwork, rats spoil the grain allocated to feed a legion&rsquo;s soldiers, snakes startle the horses of couriers along the road carrying urgent messages for the organization. All of the target organization&rsquo;s endeavors take twice as long to execute as they properly should, and all rolls made to further their plans suffer a -1 external penalty. Only by beefing up security and tightening organizational standards may this Charm be effectively countered; the target organization&rsquo;s leaders must take an extended series of dramatic (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) actions, each requiring a month of effort, in order to oppose Mandate of the Hungry Mouse. Once the leadership has accumulated a number of successes equal to (the Lunar&rsquo;s activation successes times her Essence), the effects of this Charm cease, and the organization becomes immune to all uses of Mandate of the Hungry Mouse for one year.</p>

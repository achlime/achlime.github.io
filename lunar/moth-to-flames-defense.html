            <p>Like a moth to a flame, a Lunar may be drawn to the weaving of a spell. With this Charm, she may feed on the shaping sorcery&rsquo;s Essence, breaking the spell before it can be cast. By paying six motes, the Lunar enhances an unarmed physical attack against a target taking a Shape Sorcery action, her attacking limb swirling with silver streamers of raw chaos. Should the Lunar roll damage against the target, the target suffers automatic knockdown, increasing the difficulty of the (Wits + Occult) roll to maintain her Shape Sorcery action to 4. If the casting is successfully broken, the Lunar draws in five motes of Essence, streamers of energy from the broken spell flowing into her body as the magic dissipates. This Charm is equally effective against Shape Necromancy and Weave Protocol actions.</p>
<p>All motes granted by this Charm are attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Lunar&rsquo;s Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact she has on her person, allowing her to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, she can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact she possesses, replacing the motes she has committed to it from her own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Lunar may reflexively replace them with her own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</p>

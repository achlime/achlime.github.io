        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Stewards&rsquo; dedication can pull wonders from the dreamland of the Wyld. This Charm uses the connection between Wyld and Creation inherent in every Lunar to make the target, one creature or object of any size, natural to and safe within Creation. To work this Charm, the Lunar must alter a target object in some way, such as drawing her personal symbol upon it; a living creature must hold or wear something the Lunar made with her own hands.</p>
<p>Portable objects affected by this Charm may be brought out of the Wyld without fear that they will evaporate into figment, while living things may leave the Chaos and live out their days in Creation without degenerating under the weight of its stasis. Objects too large to move do not fade quickly in the Wyld, though they become susceptible to its mutative energies just like any structure built out of Creation- based materials. Lunars sometimes use this Charm to stabilize buildings, caves or other small places created by the Wyld to use them for bases of operation. A Lunar may also want to preserve some oddity of the Wyld for study. Used at the edge of Creation, Lunars can slowly push back the Wyld&rsquo;s boundaries a little patch of ground at a time. Using this Charm on objects too large to be moved costs 20 motes; all other uses cost 10 motes.</p>
<p>Things maintained by this Charm do not have their own reality. They share the Steward&rsquo;s reality and that of Luna and Gaia. Unless someone in Heaven undertakes to connect the person or object to the Loom of Fate, the object remains only partially real. If an object tied to Creation by this Charm does not interact meaningfully with things naturally of Creation during a story, roll the Lunar&rsquo;s Essence at difficulty 1, difficulty 2 if it does not interact with real things at all. Three cumulative failures on this roll indicate that the object&rsquo;s reality is lost, and it fades away.</p>
<p>Creatures who were once part of Creation but are now too mutated to survive within it suffer a level of unsoakable bashing damage when the Essence roll fails. This damage cannot heal naturally unless the creature recuperates in the Wyld. After six cumulative failures on the roll, Creation becomes inhospitable to the creature as normal, generally forcing it to return to the Wyld.</p>

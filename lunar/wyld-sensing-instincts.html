        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>By honing her senses, the Lunar attunes herself to the ebbs of the Wyld around her. So long as the character keeps this Charm active, the character&rsquo;s player may roll (Perception + Awareness) to detect where the Wyld is nearest, where it is strongest and how dangerous it may be to her or her companions. After a simple roll, she may determine these things within a number of miles equal to her rolled successes. Outside of Creation, each level of the Wyld (Bordermarches, Middlemarches, Deep Wyld) doubles this range. (The Charm is useless in Pure Chaos, where distance is meaningless and everything is equally dangerous.)</p>
<p>Wyld-Sensing Instincts guarantees that any travel the character leads through the Wyld can avoid its worst perils. Only if her awareness fails her or a malicious intent conspires against her does she risk dangerous winds of Chaos. Even then, the player may make a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll to detect the incoming danger, which should provide an advantage in the difficult times ahead. Wyld-Sensing Instincts never tells the character what <em>sort</em> of danger the Wyld presents. The Lunar may lead a group of no more than Magnitude 1 through the Wyld safely using this Charm.</p>
<p>A character using this Charm adds (Essence) successes to any Perception-based rolls to examine or find Wyld influence. Rolling (Perception + Investigation) to reconstruct past events, (Perception + Medicine) to determine a creature&rsquo;s cause of death or (Perception + Occult) to examine the Essence resonance would all qualify, so long as the Wyld is involved. The character need not be aware that Wyld is involved ahead of time to gain the bonus, so long as the Charm is active.</p>

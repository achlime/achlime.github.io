        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Stewards claim prizes from their defeated foes: part of their powers. The Lunar may activate this power to issue a formal challenge to an opponent of her own devising. This could take almost any form—a foot race, combat to first blood or to submission, to be the first to seduce the regional satrap… almost anything will do. The target is free to refuse the challenge, but if she accepts and prevails, the Lunar owes her a boon to be named by the target. Refusing or failing to discharge this debt causes the Lunar to be punished as though she had broken an oath sanctified by an Eclipse with an Essence rating equal to her own. Requested boons may not be impossible or inherently lethal, but they may be very dangerous.</p>
<p>By contrast, should the Lunar win, she may claim one of the target&rsquo;s Charms. She may only claim Charms whose minimum traits and prerequisites she meets, and which she could have potentially learned either herself or with a Lunar equivalent of the Eclipse anima power. Sidereal Martial Arts remain inaccessible. While the Lunar has claim to a Charm, the Lunar may freely use the effect as though it had been learned with the Eclipse anima power, and the target suffers a three mote surcharge on its activation cost. The Lunar&rsquo;s claim ends after one month has elapsed, though she may permanently retain the power if she wishes as a Training effect. Doing so immediately cedes her claim over the Charm, restoring its cost to normal for the original owner. Charms the Lunar could normally learn retain their standard experience point and activation costs; Charms which would require the Eclipse anima power to learn cost 20 experience points and have a two mote surcharge when activated.</p>
<p>If either the Lunar or the target agree to the challenge in bad faith (i.e., intending to rig the contest so that the Lunar may simply learn a power the target knows), the Charm fails to function.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Exercising mastery of her knowledge of pure Essence, the Lunar develops a series of artificial chakras at various points on her body, from which she is able to reflexively spin raw Essence into long strands of luminous silver webbing. These web lines may be fired up to (Intelligence x 10) yards, sticking to any object or surface they strike.</p>
<p>Essence webbing may be used to add three automatic successes to any attempt to recall loose weapons or hurled projectiles, and they may be used to make disarm attempts at range. Alternatively, the character could use his Essence webbing as a lasso or net (see <strong>Scroll of the Monk</strong>, p. 158). The webbing is also useful for various acrobatic feats, including swinging along branches from place to place, hanging suspended from an Essence line and even climbing up an extant strand of Essence. (Essence lines have a [Strength + Athletics] equivalent tensile strength equal to the Lunar&rsquo;s [Intelligence + Essence].) Other stunts are possible at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>Created Essence webbing lasts until the end of the scene, at which point it dissipates into a wash of silver motes. Each web line costs one mote to create.</p>

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This Knack enables the Lunar to take the form of another human (or basically human creature). She develops an instinctive understanding of the different sacred hunt necessary to make humans valid targets of the hunt. Taking on a false human shape costs a point of Willpower.</p>
<p>The base time of the hunt is half a day, during which time the character studies the person&rsquo;s habits and nature, absorbing them the same way she will steal the person&rsquo;s body. Some Lunars watch their victims covertly during the process; others hunt the target viciously, tormenting him and studying his reactions until the final blow. The latter method is faster but more difficult to perform in high-population areas. Either way, it&rsquo;s murder (unless the Lunar has Life of the Hummingbird and merely takes a person&rsquo;s shape temporarily). Taking a human&rsquo;s Heart&rsquo;s Blood triggers a Compassion roll in any character with Compassion 3 or greater, and each success adds one point of Limit to the Lunar&rsquo;s total, no matter what his dominant Virtue may be.</p>
<p>Lunars pursue human forms for many reasons: Having even a single human false form is useful when one&rsquo;s true form becomes dangerous and an animal shape is inappropriate. Some human forms are useful for their identities—becoming Great Forks&rsquo; Minister of Lore is a significant advantage. Finally, different human forms may have access to different resources. Stealing a wealthy merchant&rsquo;s form gives the character a lot of money to throw around, and becoming a friendly socialite comes with a host of contacts and allies. Lunar Exalted may benefit from these stolen Backgrounds temporarily, but they require effort to maintain—otherwise, the investments dry up, and friends forget about the person who is no longer often around.</p>
<p>Exalted and other human creatures may have Charms and other powers of their own. Taking on one&rsquo;s form through the sacred hunt does not give the Lunar access to any of their Essence-based powers. Taking a Lunar&rsquo;s form in this way provides only the Lunar&rsquo;s human true form, not the spirit shape or any other form the victim might know. For that, a character needs <a class="complex" href="taste-of-lunas-champions.html" title="canonical entry of knack 'Taste of Luna’s Champions'"><span class="link-focus">Taste of Luna’s Champions</span></a>.</p>

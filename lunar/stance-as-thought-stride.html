        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunars inspire those around them. With this Charm active, every first glance at the character triggers a specific thought or sort of thought. The Lunar chooses if she wants every person who looks at her to think something specific (&ldquo;she&rsquo;s dangerous,&rdquo; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s hiding something&rdquo;), to see what they most want to see in her, or to see what they least want. The Lunar does not appear as anything other than what she is, though. The magic is in the conclusions others draw. Perhaps the evil vizier believes the Lunar is here to aid the satrap, while the merchant&rsquo;s son believes the Lunar is his arranged wife-to-be, arriving just in time to eliminate his chance to flee with his true beloved. Or maybe the vizier knows with one look that the Lunar is harmless, while the son believes that the Lunar will help him escape his arranged marriage. This effect creates an instant Intimacy that remains until a subject eliminates it naturally. This unnatural mental influence costs two points of Willpower to resist.</p>

            <p>Canny Lunars know when they are being watched, and may use this heightened sensitivity to move through the world unseen—even by the pattern spiders. A Lunar using this Charm moves through the moments and spaces that escape the notice of the tenders of the Loom of Fate, rendering him invisible to astrological predictions and the Loom. All attempts to use the Loom or astrology to divine the Lunar&rsquo;s location or future automatically fail. Furthermore, the Lunar may observe many secrets from his vantage point between destiny&rsquo;s threads; all Sidereal Astrology becomes Obvious to his senses. If he chooses, he may even follow the threads of infectious destiny back to their point of origin; by starting with an individual who has had an ascending or descending destiny placed on him, the Lunar may track down the Sidereal who laid the blessing or curse, adding (Perception) automatic successes to all tracking rolls. This Charm does not inform the Lunar of which Sidereal laid any given Sidereal Astrology effect on an individual; in order to find out, he must follow destiny&rsquo;s thread and see where it leads.</p>

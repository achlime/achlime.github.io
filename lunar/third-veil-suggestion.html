        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunar Exalted are not limited to one conversation at a time. Shaping words with his Essence, the character can speak to one individual while simultaneously carrying on a separate conversation or oration. Only the target of the Lunar&rsquo;s second speech can hear those words. The character need not speak to the public to conceal his secret words; any significant ambient noise will suffice.</p>
<p>Effectively, the character makes social attacks that only one person notices. The character may change this target within the scene. Talking to conceal the speech does not consume any action. Attacks made in the secret speech benefit from two automatic successes, but remain natural mental influence.</p>

            <p>Sometimes there are too many things in the world for a single hero to defend. This is no impediment to the most potent Stewards.</p>
<p>Using this Knack, the Lunar may subdivide his Essence into multiple bodies. Over the course of one long tick, the character extrudes a second body from his own. He must allocate a number of dots of permanent Essence into the double. Those dots are then removed from the main Lunar and are considered to be the double&rsquo;s permanent Essence rating. Creating a double requires the allocation of at least two dots of Essence, and the original Steward may not reduce himself below Essence 2. The character is free to invoke this Knack to create as many doubles as his Essence dots may be spread between.</p>
<p>Doubles are semi-independent extensions of the Lunar&rsquo;s will. They share his personality, goals, traits (up to any limits imposed by their lower Essence ratings) and essentially operate as remote extensions of his mind. They do not consider themselves to be independent entities. Doubles cannot move more than a mile from the original Lunar, and will automatically denature into Essence if forcibly carried beyond that limit. They are able to use any Lunar Charms or Knacks the character knows and which their Essence rating allows. These Charms draw out of the original Lunar&rsquo;s Essence and Willpower pools, although doubles have independent health tracks. (Any damage required by Charm activation—as with, for example, Sharing the Gifts of Luna, on page 164 of The Manual of Exalted Power—The Lunars— comes from the double&rsquo;s own health track.) A double&rsquo;s Charm selections are independent of the original Lunar&rsquo;s. A Lunar and his double may each use a different Charm at the same time without need of a Combo.</p>
<p>In order to absorb the memories of anything learned by a double, or to enjoy any Heart&rsquo;s Blood additions gained by a double, the Lunar must touch the copy and spend a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -0) re-absorbing it. Doing so also restores the Essence dots lent out to create it.</p>
<p>If a double is slain, the Lunar regenerates the lost Essence dots at a rate of one per week.</p>

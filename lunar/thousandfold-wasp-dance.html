        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar takes a moment to gather all the aggression, frustration, and stress flitting through her mind and spirit. Infusing these irritants with Essence, the Exalt releases them into the world, where they bedevil her foes. The Lunar breathes out a swarm of irritating, biting insects, which fill an area with a diameter of (Essence x 10) yards, centered somewhere within (Wits x 30) yards. All characters inside of this swarm that the Lunar does not selectively decide to spare the swarm&rsquo;s wrath are subjected to an environmental damage effect (Damage 1B/ action, trauma 3) and suffer a -1 external environmental penalty. The swarm shrinks at a rate of one yard per tick if exposed to an appropriate environmental hazard, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, such as a burning building or a Terrestrial Exalt&rsquo;s iconic anima banner. Likewise, the swarm may be destroyed by sufficiently destructive area-of-effect attacks such as Total Annihilation, again at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>At Essence 4+ the Lunar may use a miscellaneous action once per action tick to control the swarm, causing it to move according to her will. The swarm drifts at a rate of five yards per tick when subjected to such control.</p>

            <p>The chimera can instantly transform its entire body into a glutinous substance that retains its general shape but allows physical attacks to pass through it without harm. The effect is instant and reflexive, costing four motes and one Willpower point. This Knack offers a perfect defense against physical attacks, but carries the Temperance Flaw of Invulnerability. This Knack does not stop elemental or pure Essence attacks, or attacks using weapons that bear the Overpowering tag—the chimera splashes when struck with such weapons.</p>

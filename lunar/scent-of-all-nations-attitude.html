        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar Exalted are most at home when walking abroad. Gathering Essence from the four winds and the earth below, the Lunar becomes a citizen of the world. Though her outward appearance does not change, there is something familiar about her to all that meet her. To a Haltan, she seems like a Haltan; to a Delzahn nomad, she seems a fellow rider of the sands; to a Dynast, she seems a native of the Realm. Observers simply overlook any differences in language, appearance, dress or mannerisms that would violate this impression. This Charm constitutes a form of unnatural mental influence costing three points of Willpower to resist for one week.</p>
<p>Alternately, the Lunar may select a particular nationality upon activating this Charm, and all she meets will believe this is her place of origin; for example, she might decide to present herself as a Haltan, and this is how she would seem to the Haltan, the Delzahn, and the Dynast.</p>

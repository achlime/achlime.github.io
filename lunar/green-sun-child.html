        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Creatures from outside Creation are beyond the powers of most Lunars. Some, however, strain to master the unnatural shapes of demonkind, to wear their skins. This was one of the most-used Knacks during the Primordial War, as Lunars strove to infiltrate their enemies. Green Sun Child makes demons valid targets for the sacred hunt, which takes the same default time as the hunt for a human. Demons who do not have blood are still valid targets; the Lunar simply has to consume some part of their vital ichors or insides. Characters do not get any of the demon&rsquo;s Essence-based powers.</p>
<p>Though the natural state of a demon is incorporeal, the Lunar&rsquo;s natural state remains material.</p>

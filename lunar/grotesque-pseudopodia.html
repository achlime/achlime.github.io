            <p>The chimera makes some part of its body grow massively in size, as flesh, tendons and strange, tumorous growths stretch the affected body part into one or more massive, tentaclelike pseudopodia. These enable the chimera to make ranged Martial Arts attacks. While this Knack is active, the affected limb becomes a disgusting conglomeration of protoplasmic matter, and the chimera cannot hold anything in its hand during the instant of the attack. Accordingly, this Knack can only be uses to facilitate unarmed attacks. The possible effects depend on how many motes the chimera expends per action:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Mote: The chimera extends one limb up to (permanent Essence x 2) yards as an instant, reflexive action. The chimera may extend its neck to make a ranged bite attack, extend an existing limb or cause an additional limb to sprout from its body, striking at its target and then returning to the body.</li>
<li>2 Motes: The chimera can stretch one limb (Essence x 5) yards to make an attack. Other potential uses include reaching the roof of a building and grabbing hold before pulling up the rest of its body.</li>
<li>4 Motes: The chimera can imbue its ranged Martial Arts attacks with great velocity and force, adding +5 to its damage on a single unarmed attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a weapon Pseudopod Strike has the following statistics: Speed 4, Accuracy +2, Damage +4B (or +9B), Defense +3, and Rate 3.</p>

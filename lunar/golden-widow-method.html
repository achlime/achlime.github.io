        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>This grim Knack provides special benefits if a character selects her Solar mate as the target of a sacred hunt. The hunt must be lethal—nothing less than death will satisfy Golden Widow Method&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>Upon successfully drinking down her Solar mate&rsquo;s Heart&rsquo;s Blood, the Lunar immediately gains one free dot of permanent Essence and suffers Limit Break, regardless of her current Limit. This dot of Essence is not gained as a Training effect. It may exceed the Lunar&rsquo;s current age limit and is considered valid for all purposes, including those of raising Attribute and Ability dots and buying Charms.</p>
<p>The permanent Essence dot fades after a year and a day. All purchased traits that the Lunar can no longer sustain due to his reduced Essence rating remain, but may not actually be used while he fails to satisfy the requirements for them. Of course, the Solar Exalted always reincarnate&hellip;</p>
<p>This Knack <em>will</em> function if the character&rsquo;s mate has become one of the Abyssal Exalted, a Green Sun Prince or an akuma, but in addition to provoking immediate Limit Break, consuming such tainted Essence also gives the Lunar one point of permanent Limit, even if she has caste-fixing tattoos. Permanent Limit gained in this fashion fades at a rate of one point per five years if the Lunar refrains from use of this Knack during that period. If the Lunar accumulates a simultaneous total of five permanent Limit points via use of Golden Widow Method, the damage becomes permanent and irreversible.</p>

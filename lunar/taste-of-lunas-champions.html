        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The character with this Knack has the power to taste the blood of another Lunar Exalt, who must be willing, and learn a shape the other Lunar has mastered. The Knack requires a 15-minute ritual and costs a point of Willpower from the Lunar using this Knack, whose player rolls (Willpower + Essence). Each success increases the number of shapes he may learn by one (from a base of one) or doubles the period over which he can use each shape (base one hour). The character can instead master a shape forever by spending a point of experience per shape.</p>
<p>This Knack also gives the Lunar a rarely used ritual that targets another Lunar as the subject of the sacred hunt. In this case, the character must hunt down and fight the target Lunar. After killing the target, the Lunar drinks the target&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s blood and gains every shape the other Lunar has mastered and the target&rsquo;s human and animal true forms (though they do not become new true forms). The war form is too unique to each Lunar&rsquo;s Essence to be duplicated in this way. (Note that cannibalizing a selection of heart&rsquo;s blood forms increases the character&rsquo;s Heart&rsquo;s Blood Background. Some Storytellers may rule that this costs experience points—see pp. 232-233.)</p>

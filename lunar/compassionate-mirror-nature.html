        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>The Lunar understands a compassionate alternative to the standard hunt for a human&rsquo;s shape. She dedicates the sacred hunt to Luna with an invocation of her belief in guarding Creation and its life, then she pursues her quarry as normal. Once the period of observation is over, she renders her victim unconscious (not dead) and tastes his blood. She acquires his shape permanently, but the victim lives. When the victim dies, the effects of Flickering Star Infusion begin as normal, as if the Lunar had killed the victim outright. Taking a human form in this way triggers no Compassion roll.</p>

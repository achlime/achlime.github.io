        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Shifting to another shape, the character develops greater control over superficial details. For any learned shape, she can control the creature&rsquo;s appearance to a degree. Fur or feathers can be any color appropriate to the creature, and such identifying marks as scars and birthmarks are under the character&rsquo;s control. Human shapes are more set, but the Lunar gains the ability to change the appearance of her clothes and hair length.</p>
<p>This power becomes inherent to shifting shape, not something the character can alter without also changing shape. She can change shape to a variation of the same creature, changing superficial features in the transition to a near-identical shape.</p>

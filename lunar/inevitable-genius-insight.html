        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>Lunar Exalted are brilliant, if erratic. Focusing her Essence, the character expands her mind and senses to encompass greater things. She becomes an unstoppable mental juggernaut, nearly immune to distraction and capable of reaching heights previously beyond her. Lunars used this Charm after the Usurpation to develop the moonsilver tattoos that protect them.</p>
<p>When the character activates this Charm, the player declares a single project or research target for the Charm. While this Charm is active, the character adds one success to all rolls related to her chosen research. Increase the maximum number of dice she may add to any rolls based on mental Attributes by her Essence. She ignores all fatigue penalties.</p>
<p>Until the project&rsquo;s completion, the player must make a successful (Willpower) roll in order to take actions unrelated to her declared focus for a scene. Those suffer a -2 penalty. To end the Charm before concluding the project, the player must roll (Willpower) at a difficulty of (Temperance), something she may only attempt once per scene.</p>

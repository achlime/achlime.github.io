        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>After a chimera consumes a victim through Assimilation of the Prey, the chimera can then expel an amount of its own body matter and shape it into the form of the creature the chimera has just devoured. The offspring is not a true living creature, but an amalgamation of excess body mass mentally under the control of the chimera. The chimera can perceive through the offspring&rsquo;s senses and can direct its movements. While controlling the offspring, the chimera has access to all the creature&rsquo;s normal instincts, memories and natural abilities (but not actual Abilities, Charms or other magical powers). However, if the chimera attempts to act on its own and also direct the offspring, the chimera suffers flurry penalties based on the total number of actions taken with both bodies.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the chimera can temporarily release control of the offspring, which will act as if it were the original creature and, if sentient, actually believe that it is the original creature. The chimera can reassert control over the offspring at any time, and the offspring will never voluntarily move more than a mile away from its creator.</p>
<p>Only Charms or stunts can possibly tell the difference between an offspring and the creature it mimics. Creating an animal offspring requires the commitment of six motes of Essence during the offspring&rsquo;s existence. Creating a human offspring requires the commitment of 10 motes and the expenditure of one Willpower point. A human offspring can duplicate anything the original was wearing not made of a magical material by shaping excess skin into the appropriate cloth or material. The chimera can only create an offspring based on an animal or a person, but not a demon, god, ghost or other totally supernatural creature. The offspring dies when the Essence commitment ends and vice versa.</p>
